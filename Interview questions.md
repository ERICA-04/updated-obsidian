## **Strength**
I am a great team member. I like to communicate as often as needed with the team to check up on them, if they need anything or help on the task and if we are on the right track.

I am also initiative. I take initiative when needed. when I notice that team is not making any progress towards the goal and there is stagnant. I take actions that are necessary to make the team back on the track.

With that being said, I am confident with my collaborative skills and how I work with other to achieved set goals.

Lastly, I have strong determination. so whatever obstacle I face I have defaulted myself to always find a way to make things work and to consistently improve myself.

## **What are your weakness**
- My weakness is that I am blunt, I am very straightforward person. I tend to speak  my thoughts without filtering it so sometimes other people misunderstood it. that is something I am aware of and I am actively working on my delivery tone 
- I also have trouble with delegating task. I tend to take majority of the task and do everything myself. And I'm working on it through being mindful and being conscious on taking task. 
- difficult for me to express my ideas and thoughts verbally when im under pressure
- difficult to put it out in words 
- difficult for mto be contruvtive 
- structure in saying ideas

- diffuclty in communicating when under pressure
- I tend to compare myself with other people's capabilities
- Because I evaluate my self through the capabilities of other. 
- which makes me think that I am always lacking 
- because I am surrounded by talented and amazing people
- that's my weakness, i always feel like i am lacking even if people say that I am doing great. 
- and because of that i always put extra effort to everything I do because if I don't I feel like I'll be left behind 


- I don't like competition I am more into collaboration, I like sharing my answers, ideas,
- i am driven on serving the purpose and making customer satisfied than being better than the competitor
