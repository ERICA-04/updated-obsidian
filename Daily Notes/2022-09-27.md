### Random `fas:PencilAlt`
 **Key Features: What would set one movement apart from the others based on the works of art produced?**
- In 1908, the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti dramatically swerved into a ditch to avoid hitting two cyclists. The face-off between old and new transport gave him the idea for a new philosophy. He became obsessed with everything the future had to offer and he wanted everyone else to be too. He laid out his ideas to the world in his Manifesto of futurism on the font page of the French newspaper le figaro.
- What this movement set apart from the others is that the futurist attitude was far more excessive, they actually wanted to destroy past culture and traditions and become the epicenter of progress.
- Futurists glorified speed, violence, and the working classes, they believe these were necessary to become modern country.
- All paintings produced by futurists depict one united concept of violence.
- futurist are very supportive of violence. the founder Marinetti consider violence as a necessary step toward making a new modern italy 
- this belief actually resulted to the death of a lot of futurist for they were encouraged to fight for their country during the world war 1
- After the world war 1 there were new futurist artist continuing the works of those who died during the war.
- Marinetti merged this with Mussolini’s party and wrote its manifesto 
- Mussolini supports fascism a political ideology.
- when the merged happed there were Many Italian Futurists that become supporters of Fascism even though futurism was never an official art of fascism. Though 2 ideologies had a lot in common They were strongly patriotic, supportive of violence, and opposed to parliamentary democracy.

- Many artists and art movements, particularly in Russia, England, and Belgium, were influenced by the Italian Futurists. This is due to futurists' desire to spread their aesthetic, political, and social ideals as widely as possible. They developed the newest technologies such as mass media, printing, and transportation, and they printed over a hundred manifestos

**Major artists: Who are the artists from this movement that would best represent it**
Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, and Luigi Russolo were among the first artists associated with Futurism in the visual arts. They banded together and wrote the Futurist Painters Manifesto. They transformed Marinetti's call to arms into a call to paintbrushes by denouncing the existing art scene as stagnant, academic, and rife with imitators.

These early major artists created techniques to express speed and motion in order to achieve movement and dynamism in their art. Blurring and repetition were among the techniques used. They also used lines of force, which was a method adopted by the Cubists.

**Defining works: What are the best-known pieces that exemplify the movement? Restrict yourselves to paintings and sculptures.

First major futurist work to grasp the nation’s attention was Boccioni's “The City Rises” which depicted the construction of Milans’ new electrical power plant.  

  

He painted it while residing in Milan, a fast-growing city at the time, in which he portrayed the modern city-state of transformation and the constant stream of noise and movement associated with urban life; observe the scaffolding on the building in the background, as a large crowd of workmen tried to manage a powerful horse in the foreground. Men and horses, melted together in a cooperative and dynamic effort, dominate the composition. The glorification of human labor and the energy of a contemporary industrial city are two of Futurism's most defining characteristics that Boccioni has emphasized in this picture.**
