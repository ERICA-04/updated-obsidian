## About yourself
I am Erica Jobelle Ayudan, I am 21 years old, currently in my 4th year in college. My course is Bachelor of Science in Information Systems Specializing Service Management. I would describe myself as an explorer, adventurous, who likes to go out of her comfort zone, someone who likes to take challenges. I am someone who grabs the opportunity to improve myself and skills whenever there is. And I am a proud gamer, I am not pro but I do like to play online games and explore the gaming community. Just to add being a gamer brought a lot of opportunity to me from learning to develop a discord bot, learning how to manage discord servers, managing concerns, and to becoming one of the discord moderator of the Official esports arm of the university. And despite of all the adventures and gaming, I stayed as a scholar and consitent dean lister. 

Challenges if ask:
1. I am very shy but I challenge myself to go out of my comfort zone and just talk to people in the gaming community that made me gain a lot of online friends and help me cope up during the pandemic.
2. Again, I am really shy and to help me be more confident   I would participate to some university activities like mock up interviews.
3. Learning outside university like enrolling on courses online which is the UX/UI design
4. I took the backend dev role in our capstone even though I am more comfortable and knowledgeable on front end development

## Strength
I am a great team member. I like to communicate as often as needed with the team to check up on them, if they need anything or help on the task and if we are on the right track.

I am also initiative. I take initiative when needed. when I notice that team is not making any progress towards the goal and there is stagnant. I take actions that are necessary to make the team back on the track.

With that being said, I am confident with my collaborative skills and how I work with other to achieved set goals.

Lastly, I have strong determination. so whatever obstacle I face I have defaulted myself to always find a way to make things work and to consistently improve myself and learn. 

## Weaknesses
- It is difficult for me to express ideas and thoughts verbally when I'm under pressure, like when there's a lot of people that i don't know. It is difficult to me to construct a sentence that would perfectly describe my idea. I tend to speak fast and share only a little bit of my ideas.

## what inspires you?

- I was also inspired by people who works in this industry who take it as an opportunity to improve the way technology impacts the lives of people and consider the marginalized and underrepresented. 

## what are your values?
- courage
    - it is something that I should have to be able to step out of my comfort zone
- kindness and compassion
    - be kind to everyone, we are all going through something. Kindness could mean a lot to someone

    - showing appreciation. Life is less heavier when you are more appreciative than just pure complains.

    - Authenticity is being truthful about who you are. It means speaking your truth, openly and honestly â€” not hiding for fear of criticism or judgment, which will come anyway.
- balance
    - balance between achieving your goals and enjoying the moment.
