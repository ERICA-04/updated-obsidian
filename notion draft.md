I am a student taking up a Bachelor in Science Information Systems Major in Service Management at the University of Santo Tomas. I am an aspiring UX/UI designer but being a college student helped me become versatile! I have played a number of roles during my three and a half years of college, including quality assurance, front-end developer, back-end developer, and project manager. Regardless of the job position, my aim is to contribute to the creation of a more equitable society by providing my knowledge and technical skills.
