There’s an endless supply of job-preparation resources available to you. Here are a few to get you started.

-   [Interview tips from Google](https://careers.google.com/interview-tips/?src=Online%2FSocial%2FNewYearNewJob&utm_campaign=&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Online). This resource from the Google Careers team provides best practices and advice on how to prepare and ace your interviews at Google, but of course these tips will work at any company!
    
-   [11 Common UX Design Interview Questions You'll Be Asked](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/make-sure-you-can-answer-these-11-ux-design-interview-questions/). CareerFoundry’s article about common interview questions for UX designers will give you some ideas about what to expect during the conversations themselves. There’s no reason to memorize answers, but thinking about how you might respond to these questions (and others you might find online) is a good practice for talking about yourself and your experience in the industry.
    
-   [Interview Prep for UX Design Roles with Adobe](https://www.springboard.com/blog/interview-prep-for-ux-design-roles-with-adobe/). This blog post on the Springboard blog outlines the ways to prepare for an interview at Adobe, but the advice holds for other companies too. A video interview with a UX designer at Adobe is featured as well.
    
-   [5 examples of unethical design interviews & how to navigate them](https://dribbble.com/stories/2019/09/24/how-to-navigate-unethical-design-interviews). Not every company acts appropriately at this stage of the process (asking for free “spec work,” for example). This article on Dribbble describes ways that interviewers might take advantage of you during the design interview. 
    
-   [UX Challenge](https://www.uxchallenge.co/). This tool, similar to the one at Sharpen that you used during the program, provides prompts for you to work through to create novel designs and solve user problems
    
-   [DESIGNERCIZE](https://designercize.com/). This is another design generator to explore. The interface looks like a computer from the 1980s, for a change of pace! As you practice creating solutions for these prompts, don’t forget to talk aloud about your design choices and methods. The hiring committee is going to want to know how you think.
