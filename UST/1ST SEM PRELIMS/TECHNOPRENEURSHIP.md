#####  Assignments 
1. Browse the first lecture notes for week 1 and week 2 provided to you in the lecture notes tab. Expect a graded interactive discussion next meeting
- Entreprenuer produce innovative solution. They want their product to live its purpose
- investors provide money. They want their money back

2. Read this article and answer this discussion question, "Is building a startup for everyone?  Write your short answer in a post-it note. The presentation will be next meeting.

In my opinion, everyone, anyone can do start up, with the right set of skills and knowledge. However, not everyone may succedd in that path because base from the article" Technopreneurs need to work without pay until their ideas become commercially viable" and not everyone may be able to live without pay unless they are already rich.


- it is not as much about the money as it is about the affirmation that the ‘idea’ is a worthy one and that it works.
- Technopreneurs need to work without pay until their ideas become commercially viable. It is not often easy and they have to persevere, lead and motivate their team, search for people with the money, pitch their idea and get them to join forces.
- A technopreneur constantly learns and improves, innovates and disrupts the workings of people, organizations and nations as a whole.
-  (Elon Musk failed 10 times but kept on trying till he thrilled the world)

Good day, this is the post pandemic problem i come up with which is similar to what my classmate has already presented. the problem is that 
People are becoming less cautious about the virus.
Since we are now transitioning to new normal, schools are opening, businesses are opening again, and employees are going onsite, fear and awareness about the virus is going down which in some point can cause the spread again of the virus.

SO the solution i come up with is An app or website that is about health and wellness but my classmate already presented this so a second i came up with second option an Email notifications about the following. Since pandemic happened everyone was exposed with technolgy specially email so by this email notifcation, we can disseminate information about diseases, issues and update  on global epidemiological situation and present data in a way that everyone could understand. 

I know that there are a lot of websites and also WHO has a legitimate website where they post infomormation but the problem is all these websites are not interactive and user centered, in shorts its boring and just full of long articles that only few will read
 
So the email I envision is not a typical boring email that will be forgotten  in the inbox full of unread emails. Ofcourse it must be "agaw atensyon" and the content must be user centered, easy to read and informative. 

Thats it for my presentation. Thank you
