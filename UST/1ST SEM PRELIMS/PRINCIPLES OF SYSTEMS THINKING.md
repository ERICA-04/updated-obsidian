# PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMS THINKING


## Saturday, August 13th 2022
### Introduction to Systems Thinking – Video
- Goal is to formalize what u already know
- Thinking in a more broad and holistic way – Systems Thinking
- Put constituents parts together and thinking about those interactions.
- actor are the people, they are the one who make decisions and those decisions create some sorts of reaction interaction and change and will ripple to parts of the system or throughout the system. 
- To develop critical thinking in a broad and holistic way that allows consider multiple perspective and understand different processes
- By understanding processes and perspective and developing critical thinking skills we can develop placed based solution something that is not generalizable to places beyond you are working. You understand what they are going through.
- Identifying patterns and underlying processes structures and what's happening?
- create satisfying long term solutions to chronic problems.
- expands solutions.
- it broadens our thinking
- it helps us articulate solutions in new different ways. 
- helps us make informed decision because we are incorporating different perspective.



##### Assignments 
What is Systems Thinking and Why it is important?
- System thinking is seeing the connection betweeen things or processes in a system and the logic or theory behind the connection.
- It is important because it can help us understand the underlying processes and what's really happening in a system. And that will broaden our thinking and create more informed and long term solutions. 
- System is like a multiple individual part that are connected to each other to serve a purpose and contains several processes to achieve its purpose.

Give one example of complicated and one chaotic system.
- big family tree
- election system
- transition from manual to automation or any changes wihtin a company
- getting or requesting papers from the university university
- complicated systems exhibit predictable behaviours.
- Simple: Fully knowable and predictable.
- Complicated: Not easy to know (not simple) but once known, fully predictable
- Complex: Not knowable; models provide tools for reasonable predictions within boundaries.

### Chapter 1: Systems Principles
System Thinking is to give everyone of you a wide perspective on how you see things
subjective intended to teach you how how to make proper decision and how to resolve problems 
In every decision there is No right or wrong trhere is a fit in every situation
Everything has implications, our decisions are affected by factors, there is input and output 
Need to condiser the incoming fdactors and iuts outcome
In every decision you are push  to makea limit to make a decision and stand for it and that deciison will have imp;lications

Basuc concepts
- system - system functions provide outcome/output but you need intergation of parts thats the system
- if system ay tinanggal part it wont work as it was intended meaning its a sign the system ginagalaw
- if part ang ginagalaw dagdag man sa iba or remove and the pinteded purpose is not changing - HEAP
- Heap - composes a system
-  breaksdown from a bigger ang system, look at the sub system s and parts of the subsysrtem it is - anlaysis - top to bottom
- analyze from the bottom(components of system) to up. experiment the components to other bigger parts of the system - synthesis 
- system - function, outpput and property
- heap - is just a part of it
System
- compose of people to achieve certain goals 

COMPLEXITY
Detail Complexity
- highly integrated
- increased difficulty/complexity
- SYSTEM IS COIMPKEX BECAUSE OF MOVBING PART
- NOT A SIMPLE SYSTEM

Dynamic Complexity
- comlex because of the connection between other parts
- dynamic because there is different states or status
- ex. ecossyetm ng order management - need people - peopel are either senior or new 
- varying status makes the system complex because of the barrier status
- 

systems are change resistance 
- cahmges are modifications which adds a v alue there is a beneift in system becuase there is a additional component - leverage
- any imPorvemnet in the system, in wokring ecosystem it is leverage

Decisions are influence by external factor likewise it has outcome because of that umiikot ang outcome an dinput in a ecosystem

in system thinking u need to think in circkles rather than staright line beacuse it forms feedback loopd

Feedback loop
- outcome produce an feedback loop that is going to influience you to improve
- feedbacks helps you reduce of the manitude oor efects of the system 
- help you steer the direction
- 2 kinds of feedback
	- reinforcing feedback - magnify ythe initial outcome. inrtent is positive change.
	- balancing feedback - bawasn ang aggressive efefects of system. remove the major effects of the 

one good cahrateristivs of management thinjing is a feed fortward
- predicts or anticipate the oputocme if you do a option
-  one step ahead
- thinking a head


- complex system matagl feedback
- time delay
- project managemen tdecision marami dadaanan maddedelay na you should have think abou this before thi shapppened for better outcome
- 
- 


### Chapter 2: Systems Principles
- considerations
- why there is changes or outcome for every decision
5 systems principles
each are interacting to all of each iother, colement, aplify or balance out one from the other
- Openness - desxcribes boundaries of the system. evrythinh in veerythin else meaning there is interaction to all. boundaries can extend depending on the context 
	- close system - limited boundary may intended outcome and funciton and dont go beyon it. systems thnat are straightforward thinking. example is computer input process output only and no feedback. 
	- rule
		- predict and prepare
			- human nature - try to control as muich as we can
			- accept uncontorl variables and adapt to what you can control - locus of control
			- the more you manage your locus of control it is easier for you to manage a workng system
			- but the more you go beyong the locus of control thmore frustrations come in because you dont get the intended output 
			- when you go beyon dthe locus of control you can only do is influence. cant control but influence
			- 
		- recreater the futtre  - look - eliminate the  yung differeneces
			- understand what u can control
			- manage yourself kung hanggang saan lang kaya mo control
			- then influence if u get them align to what u want then you get the desired output of your system
- Purposeness - outcome you desire
	- intended outcome - value
	- main driver is to understand the purpose of oding that system
	- answr the question why 
	- decide because of emotions or we use mind to see the logical things a reltiona choice.
	- Rational choice may not be the popular deciison, it may look logically good but not all rthe time it should be choisen
	- if you untegrate ethical principles to rational thinking it becomes wisdom - ito dapat
	- factors
		- rational
		- emotional
		- cultural
			- ethics is usally define by a cultiure
	- outcome triggered react, respoind, act
		- react - your behavior is triggered by stimulus for you to behave sceifically that way
		- respomse - two way behavior. a sitmuluis trigers yiou and question then you agreed to a behavior. tanungan till an agrreeement. major decisions in orgs, u dont ac cept new rules immediately, you will ask questions about it
		- action - do it no matter what. no eefffect?
- multidimension
	- dichotomies - two intended outcomes, win or loss
	- contnuum - for you to arrived at the two outcome may mga option ka pwedeng gawin
	- complemetary
		- tendecies may coexist, complementary, interact - find a win win siolution
		- 
	- mutual interfdeopence framework - givres you saan sang best possible outcome given the factors
		- what to prioritize high stability or high change
		- pag nagcocomeup with solutkon it could be a combination of functions, structures, and proccesses
- Emergent properties
	-  result of integration of multpile components
	- sum of actions or system if linear straight lang but people involve there is interaction it bevomes a emergent property
- counter intuitive behavior
	- expect
	- opposite of what you expect
	- result of cause and effect
	- outcomes will result to another outcome and may not be desirable


what we intend you from the subject is for you to have a wider perspecctive

### Understanding stakeholders and engaging with stakeholders

Stakeholder and stakeholder analysis 
stakeholder - any person or organization who has a vital interest at hand.
![[Pasted image 20221004210913.png]]

last three - to understand stakeholders and to identify stakeholders and capture different perspective

before using casual loops or inviting stakeholders to collaboration it is helpful to understand them first, who, where, and what are their interest.

APPROACHES

**STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS**
- to identify stakeholders and anticipate and what are their position in policy change or to an issue
- ![[Pasted image 20221004211442.png]]

- ![[Pasted image 20221004214050.png]]

**NETWORK ANALYSIS**
- helps you understand who are the actors in a network
- how they are related and what are their characteristics and relationships 
- how different actors share information and resources

Elements
- node - circle
- edge - lines
- attributes - size color
- directionality

**PIPA** - Participatory impact pathways analysis 
- Identify actors types
- relationship
- network map now and future

2 kind of feedback loops
- both + = Reinforcing 
- uneven - + = balancing
