**How important are they to culture and society?**
![[Pasted image 20220822132101.png]]
- Good art is provocative
- provoke critical thinking in us
- critique
- sense of nothing taking at face value 
- we have that sense to found out if its true or not
- it should allow us to engage in critical way in intelligent way not in finding fault way.
**- bad art** - those who don't conform to the standard of what is considered to be artistic and aesthetic at that time


- how do u say that r really an artist?
	- u don't only consider yourself
	- your interpretation should not only the sole basis of it. 
	- refer to sources presented by people of authority with credibility and integrity
	- they have the credentials and back up
	- imitate first and then innovate later
	- tradition first before you could innovate on it
	- you are an individual who exist as part of the society, so its you relating to the world


**How does art help define your concept of what is beautiful?**
![[Pasted image 20220822204045.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220822204115.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220822204207.png]]
 
- first sentence is wrong
- you may not like it, but you can understand why this work of art is beautiful by reading or considering the critiques
- inherent references kaya daw opposite 

![[Pasted image 20220822204517.png]]

- as culture and as recipient of critiques and historians (us, critics ata today) - art experts they have studied it and   they know what they are doing
- if agreed on certain standard of what is beautiful according to how art is created and perceived and we will see this as we study the history of art, styles, characteristics
- nagbabago ang standard ng what is beautiful
- experts and critiques would agree to the changes of standard of what is a good art 
- **Postmodern** - appreciates morality influx of so many resources in one work and celebrate differences rather than similarites 
- micro narratives rather than macro narratives
- personal history is as important as the national history
- small parts are important as the bigger part
-  why monalisa, starry night are more beautiful than the other?
	- because they conform to standards the critique thinks are above anything else
- postmodern mindset is so suspicious of authority of anything that unifies universalizes or standardizes  
- before postmodern  they only conform to only what is major and canonical and don't recognize of the minor and less recognize artist.

**What are the purposes and themes of art?**
![[Pasted image 20220822211812.png]]
- art exist for its own purpose
- art for art's sake
- it does not exist to served other purpose
- art can be utilitarian, china's wine pot is an example
- craft that is useful
- does art need a purpose?
- function of art is to record historical milestone


**aisthanomai** 
- Alexander Baumgarten - coined the term - 18th century - German philosopher

### The nature of art
Art as creation

**etymology of art** 
	- **ars** (latin) - "skill"
	- **techne** (greek) - "technology"

You need skills and technology to do art = **proficiency**

Proficiency; perfection ->  **ORDER**
	- sense of order in the sense of design because resulting work must follow a certain order

- nothing in art is accidental everything is in design
- something happens in a happy accidents but artist at least plan or idea what they want to do before they do their art
- there is a planning involve because order has to be followed if its chaotic most probably people will think its not art
- that's why some abstract are upsetting and unorganized because they do not understand it and it looks like a mess

"Skills and products primarily intended to delight the senses and produce a satisfying experience of the 
beautiful." - Oritz, et. al., p.9)


**Aesthetics** 
- to perceive with the senses
- sense of perception 
- empirical - you know something is real if you perceived it with your senses


**THE NATURE OF ART**
	- Art as expression and communication

- **Genius**  
	- individual talent
	- very unique and original take on world

**Mileu**
	- geography
	- time
	- philosophy
	- we are in post modern



**Nature vs Nurture** – debate in social psychology
- nature - born with it
- nurture - learned it, practice it


<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">There is always a message that the artist wants to convey</mark> 

If you get the message the artist wants to convey the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">art is successful</mark> 

If you have different interpretation, don't just interpret on your own take on it, there is a responsibility you need to fulfill if you don't know anything about it, you need to research about it.


**Communication in art**
- response of audience by engaging with art
- contemplating on it and analyze how it makes them feel
- decode the message of the art for it is not obvious. you have to spent time to figure it out


<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Artist as the genius</mark> is influence by<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> milieu which they lived</mark> lived in and the p<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">roduct becomes the way to communicate</mark> with an audience and they response by writing about it 


**Context collapse**
- one post can taken out of context
- web of responses
- focus on one aspect of the whole context


**The scream**
- humanoid
- no eyebrows, no hair
- scream connotes negative  
- the scream did not reach the audience by looking at the elements of the painting
- lines are moving away from the humanoid
- lines surrounding him are away from him
- colors are not calming 
- setting around him is swirling away from him
- Linear perspective = vanishing point
- Surrealist - dream light
- the colors is like takipsilim - nagaagaw ang liwa ag at dilim

**Juan Luna, Spoliarium (1884)**
- **Allegory** for what was happening at the time it was made. What Luna thinks about what  happened to Filipinos and Philippines with Spanish colonization. Suffered over 3 centuries. He did not depict Philippines in his time. He depicted acts of cruelty in a different time, time of roman gladiator? ancient Rome. 
- The point of **allegory** Use it to express what was happening at during his time without being explicitly about it.

- Details on dress 
- folds indicates movement in a sense of **naturalism** 
- Expressions 
- dramatic Tension IN TERMS OF lightning
- dominant shape in the painting is **Triangle**

- trample on the powerless
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">you don't need to be told everything explicitly it can be symbolic  shown everything </mark> 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good literature never explains its address rather than  - Show don't tell</mark> 
- color symbolizes many things, you choose the appropriate meaning base on the context
- green indicates life just like trees, nature
- the woman is the representation of human dignity that is lacking everywhere else in the painting
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">powerful message and it resonate regardless of generation or century because its the beauty of allegory because it is not time bound and limited in the period it is made</mark> 
- triangle is the most stable shape in architecture - it cant be bent out of shape easily and economical
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">triangle can be a symbol of inequality the needs are not equal</mark> 
- the base is bigger than the peak

- what makes the painting beautiful? **Craftsmanship**
- how it's painted and executed 
- folds in clothes, hairdress, the little details
- examine our own biases for what is beautiful
- the painting goes against every beauty standard we have
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">what is suggested is more impactful</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is something is not said explicitly you have to work for the meaning that makes it significant</mark> 



**Value judgments = SUBJECTIVE**

Art can be many different things, and “beautiful” (what is pleasing to the eye) is just one of them.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Art that touches the intellect and the emotions ultimately brings far greater satisfaction.</mark> 



**Art is man-made and not nature**
- art cant exist in nature it should be made
- art can be inspired by the nature
- web is beautiful but it is not art despite of perfection because spiders are not artist they do it because of their instincts out of its nature
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">art is by design</mark>

People expect art to be beautiful.

People also expect art to mimic the real world

**Preconception:** Adeptness at **realism** (replication of reality) = Authentication of artistry (**proficiency**)


**Realistic paintings**

- not everybody can do it
- what is realistic is what is beautiful
- people's bias towards realistic art 
- art what makes an art beautiful because its close to reality which shows the talent of artist 

**THE NATURE OF ART
- Art is not nature.
- "Nature and art, being two different things, cannot be the same thing. Through art we express our conception of what nature is not" - Pablo Picasso

- fan 


**Pablo Picasso, Dora Maar Sitting (1939).**
- more upbeat
- more youthful appeal
- photographer - surrealist mode
- abstraction of her rather than a realistic portrayal of her is more fitting because you're not supposed to take her work literally and not to take her as a woman literally  either

**Defamiliarizes** = jars us from complacency

- Strictly, there are only seven hues: those of the rainbow. 
- Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
2. **intensity (Chroma or Saturation)**
- This is the brightness or dullness of a hue created by mixing a color with its complement (e.g., red with green). The chroma or saturation of a color is a measure of how vibrant or intense it is. Think of it as "pure, bright color" compared to a color diluted with white, or darkened by black or grey.
3. **value(tone)
- Value or tone is the quality and depth of a color, particularly the graduations from light to dark. A color may be "toned down" to make it less vivid, or "toned up" to make it more solid or brighter.
- It is a measure of how light or dark a color is, without any consideration for its hue. Value may further be classified as the shade of a color, composed by adding more black pigment, or a tint, composed by adding more white pigment.
- work in relationship with the colors around them
- relationship between black, whites and grays

**Intensity**
- Degree of lightness and darkness in a color


**black and white** 
- look dramatic
- interplay of light and shadow

**The differences between intensity and value:**
- with intensity you're considering how pure or intense the hue is; with value you're not considering what the hue is at all - just how light or dark it is
- intensity is either bright or dull; value is either light or dark
- you create intensity by adding more or less of its complementary hue; you create value by adding black or white to a pigment.

**Variety** - principle of difference. too much is chaos. provides interest
**Goal of artist** - use both in temperance. find middle ground to create **harmony** between the two

2. **Balance** 
- distribution of visual weight in a composition. (what looks visually light or visually heavy)
Visual weight- work is whether the work looks like or heavy base on the elements presented on the frame
- what looks visually heavy or light depends on what is next right to it 
**3 kinds of balance** 
symmetrical -  when visual weight is distributed evenly 
asymmetrical - distribution is not even
radial 

**Symmetrical Balance**
- "forms of a composition mirror each other across a central axis, an imaginary horizontal or vertical line that divides the composition half" (Getlein,122)
- one half of the composition mirrors the other half exactly

- **2 senses**
    - distribution of visual weight is not equal
    - elements on side do not match on the other side

Principles of visual balance
Heavy - light

In the tradition of painting nudes in art (cf. our discussion on the Renaissance), what I love about the “Odalisque” is that it is manages to be sensual even though we are only looking at the woman’s backside. It is however not pornographic, since it does not serve to titillate.
