# EVALUATION OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, AND AUDIT

## Saturday, [[2022-08-20]]
### Week 1 and 2 Evolution of Quality and Industry Influence on Quality
**Reflected in a report result of audit**
- To know if the business is still performing well or not


**Business Performance**
- Business performance, which is closely tied to commercial effectiveness, is determined by the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ability of a company to implement optimal organization with the aim of offering a product or service that meets the expectations of consumers and customers.</mark>
- Performance as a reflection of commercial effectiveness.


**Commercially effectiveness**
- capability to achieve its goal and expected results
- **base on multiple criteria**
	- quality of service
	- customer relationship management
	- management style
	- effective incentive compensation and employee motivation
- what drive improvement


"In business, the idea of measuring what you are doing, picking the measurements that count like customer satisfaction and performance...you thrive on that." - Bill Gates
    - to always meet the satisfaction of the customer 
	- you are doing well if you can still provide the ever changing needs of customer


 **Overall business performance** can be defined as the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ability of a business to implement a strategy to achieve organizational objectives</mark> and is considered as an important tool for businesses <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">to analyze how effective management is at achieving business goals.</mark>



**Key Performance Indicators**
Measure to understand, analyze, visualize if the business is still meeting its goal
- Labor productivity
	- productive
	- mas madaming naooferan ng services
- Looking at how many new customers make purchases,
- net sales growth
	- dapat may new customer na pumapasok
- Customer satisfaction ratings
	- encourage new users because of proven service
	- reliability
- Monthly traffic generated from the business's website
- Order delivery and fulfilment speed.


**Security**
• the quality or state of being secure

• is protection from, or resilience against, potential harm caused by others, by restraining the freedom of others to act.

• A security, in a financial context, is a certificate or other financial instrument that has monetary value and can be traded. 

• Securities are generally classified as either equity securities, such as stocks and debt securities, such as bonds and debentures.

• **Security for information technology (IT)** refers to the methods, tools and personnel used to defend an organization's digital assets.

- free from danger 
- safety - free from anxiety
- credentials - personal information should not be release public
- Authentication
- **Safety**
	- correlation
	- u feel safe when secured
- **Protection** - protects information
- **Private** - not everyone have access
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">protects assets form being stolen, disrupted, exploited</mark>
- important in IT because it <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">enables safe operation of any application implemented, it protects the data the company collects and uses</mark>

**Data privacy act**
- law to protect the fundamental human rights of privacy

**Why security important in a business**
- safe operation
- protects the data the organization collects and uses


**Audit**
• an official inspection of an individual's or organization's accounts, typically by an independent body.

• is the examination or inspection of various books of accounts by an auditor followed by physical checking of inventory to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> make sure that all departments are following documented system of recording transactions. </mark>

• The purpose of an audit is to form a view on whether the information presented in the financial report, taken as a whole, reflects the financial position of the organization at a given date

- counter checks accuracy of financial statements provided by organization
- if the data reports submitted is accurate compare to actual

**3 types of audit**
- **external** - commonly perform by cpa
- **internal** 
- **internal revenue service audits**


**Evolution of Quality and Industry Influence on Quality Standards**

**Quality**
• Conformance to a specific requirement/s or standard/s

• Absence of defects, errors, or mistakes.

• The standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">degree of excellence</mark> of something.

• Quality is **the totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy given needs**

• Quality is a **judgment of how excellent something or someone is.**

• Quality is **Conformance to Customer Expectations.**

- follows the standard 
- distinguishing characteristics
- conformance to customer expectation


**Perception of Quality**
- **Consumer's perception**
    - Fitness for use (to do what it is supposed to do)
    • Getting quality features with price consideration
	- certain brands built their reputation around the quality standard
	- human can identify quality through senses, kung maganda sound, how it feels
	- result of intuitive or subconscious thought
	- inborn ability to determine if a product have QUALITY from the way how it looks, feel, taste, and sound
	- judgmental
	- evaluate through attribute/variable
		- aesthetic
		- type of distribution channel
		- manufacturer
		- packaging
- **Producer's perception**
    - Conformance to standards with cost considerations
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the product conforms to standards hence the quality</mark>
	- meet the requirements
	- low cost production but conforms to standard


**Factors affecting Quality**
- Management
	- conduct trainings
	- policies
- Dedicated Employees
	- must be compensated well to be motivated
	- operation
- Suppliers
	- materials that do not meet the requirements = low quality
	- raw materials

## Saturday, [[2022-08-27]]
### Continuation
**Factors affecting quality**
- **Policy**
    - top manager make the policy regarding the product quality specify the extent of quality needs to be achieved. 
    - affects the quality of product
    - the level of quality
    - **consider three factors**
        - service/product market - review of market give idea customer expectation of quality and their willingness to pay for it. affects policy
    		- competition
    		- di ko naitindihan

- **Information**
    - policy is made because of the provided information
    - bench marking - effective way of obtaining important information

- **Engineering and Design**
    - Ensures that new product will be release in less time with better quality and lower cost production
    - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">translate policy to actual product </mark>
    - from idea to actual
    - innovation and creativity to have a superior quality 
    - avoid defective production

- **Materials**
    - high quality products are produce by good quality raw materials
    - pre-control - quality assurance control

### Lesson 2: Organizing for Quality Management
- Base in order for them to provide quality
- Relationship between quality of a product and organization that is responsible of the development of a product that is multi dimension on providing quality
- Multiple dimension on providing quality 
- Relationship depends upon many factors like strategy, business structure, talents, available resources
- How organization could be structured to implement a quality program and achieved the project quality objective

**Quality Program**
- framework for building  into a product doing the evaluation necessary to see if it is doing well otherwise improve it
- evaluating quality achieved in the product

**Quality Management Framework**
- The Quality Management Framework summarizes the responsibilities 
associated with each of the goals and its relevant principal activities 
and business processes.

- The original goal of the QMF that was developed in 1982 was to place 
quality in proper perspective in relation to the acquisition and 
development of products, including software products.

- U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)

- Capability Maturity Model Integration® (CMMI®)

- framework concepts have been applied to software and to other 
types of products and processes

- applied to software already and other types of products and processes
- existing frameworks are improve to easy implement the concept


**Basis for the definition of "quality"**
There definitions are provided to establish the basis of quality and provide the foundation of the quality program
- **object (entity)** 
    The types of objects (entities) to which quality can be applied include: 
        • Product; 
        • Process; 
        • Service; 
        • Resource; 
        • Artifact; 
        • Activity; 
        • Measure or metric; 
        • Environment; 
        • Collection of entities or objects.

- **Product**
    - A product as any tangible output or service that is a result of a process
    - A product itself may include hardware, software, documentation, or a combination of these; also note that a service is included in the definition.
    - same principles are applied equally to service


- **Process** 
    - we view process as a set of activities performed for a given purpose, for example, a software acquisition process
    - quality of product is  dependent on the quality of the process use to create them


 - **Requirement** 
     - a requirement as a needed capability, condition, or a property attribute that must be possessed by an entity to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents 
     - a requirement is a way of characterizing a user’s need in a way that allows a development team to implement that need in the product in a concrete way.
     - needed or wanted, something required, essential to existence. 

 - **User** 
     - either the customer or the end user.
     - **customer is end user** - customer have no direct access with organization or system but have. have the same way in the access of development or maintenance of org or they are called stakeholders. a person is both a customer and end user
     - **end user** is presented by the buyer - end user does not have access to org. customer is represented by buyer
     - both have user have access to org - it either u r buyer or end user

prominent in first element of quality program which is to establish requirements - u need to identify the users need

- **Evaluation**
    - The concept and definition of evaluation is critical • As with requirements, the definitions of evaluation are varied. 
    - Evaluation is defined as the process of determining satisfaction of requirements.
    - Evaluation is “a process to evaluate the quality of products and to evaluate associated documentation, processes, and activities that impact the quality of the products”. ~ Kenett
    - may include analysis inspection reviews and test. to evaluate the quality to determine yung process how you created the product. evaluate in every phase of process

- **Measure and Measurement** - include QMF in the ability to measure the quality of processes of products and assign actual quantitative values to the items quality
    - **measure** - (v.) is to ascertain the characteristics or features (extent, dimension, quantity, capacity, and capability) of something, especially by comparing with a standard. characteristics or features
    - **measurements** - (n.) is a dimension, capacity, quantity, or amount of something (e.g., 300 source lines of code or seven document pages of design). capacity and amount quantity
    
- **Quality** 
    - prime focus of QMF. 
    - Quality is the degree to which an object (entity) (e.g., process, product, or service) satisfies a specified set of attributes or requirements
    - it is important to point out that a product possesses many quality attributes that are intrinsic to the product and that exist regardless of what is desired, specified, or measured, and only depend on the nature of the product
    - Thus, the definition of quality includes two aspects:
        - e concept of **attributes** - characteristics of entity that. quantitative or qualitative. all specified requirements governing functionality performance  and other specify characteristics such as adaptability, maintainability. determinacy of product or process quality
        - **The satisfaction or degree of attainment of the attributes. (Considering User Needs)** - perceived level of pleasure and contentment derive form individual performance. It is difficult when if they cant articulate what quality they expect. concrete user specification document. crucial. difficult to identify the needs because it is not properly identified

**Quality Program Concepts**
**Elements of a Quality Program:** 
*The Quality Program incorporates three elements that cover the activities necessary to:
1. **Establish requirements and control changes**
    - establish and specify requirements for a quality of product
2. **Establish and implement methods**
    - after identify requirements and control changes put them into action after requirements apply necessary methods.   established implement and put into action methods and procedure to develop operate deploy and maintain product
3. **Evaluate process and product quality**
    - tama ba yung mga ginawa mo in the number 2. evaluate quality of product and associate documentation. processes and activities.
![[Pasted image 20220909195837.png]]
**Interaction of the elements of quality program**
- interaction of the elements. interaction of quality program elements with the product development and implementation activities to produce quality product
- interaction is continuous with the design and implementation activities affecting the quality program activities
- both technical and management activates
- to ensure that quality is built into a product is a management activity
- specifying methods use to build ion a quality is consider a technical activity
- quality is always everybody's business
- quality program covers both technical and management activities

![[Pasted image 20220909200226.png]]
**Software Volatility Indicator** 
- indication when quality of a software likely has been qualification and test procedures need be re-executed or need reengineering
- threshold is 30%
- if it goes beyond the threshold need na degrade - result of maintenance activities
- quality degradation - base on equation
- if madami ng modules naapektuhan pag maintenance need na reengineer or re-execute or modify and system 

**Establish requirements and control changes**
- The first element or set of activities of the Quality Program is to establish requirements. 

- Product requirements must accurately reflect the product’s desired overall quality, including functionality and performance, and must be documented and baselined (formalized)

- requirements must accurately reflect the user needs
- process for defining the requirements must always ensure the needs of stakeholders that involve with the end product that have accurately capture.

**Establish and implement methods**
- The second element or set of activities of the Quality Program involves selecting, implementing, and putting into practice the appropriate processes, practices, and methods to build quality into the product and achieve the specified quality requirements

- accomplish by modifying processes practices, and methods and training the organization and project team to use them
- use appropriate practices and processes to satisfy user needs
CMMI 
- strong link between the quality product and processes that use develop and maintain it
- quality of product is highly influence with the quality of processes use to produce it 
- process model or appraisal methodology use to characterize maturity and development processes and associated procedures and methodologies to know if the process and method implement  is right to produce the quality

**Capability Maturity Model Integration® (CMMI®)**
![[Pasted image 20220909200549.png]]

**Evaluate Product and Process Quality**
- The third element or set of activities of the Quality Program involves both evaluating the implementation of processes and evaluating the quality of the resulting product(s). 

- Evaluations are used to assess:  
    - The quality of the product; 
    - The adequacy of the processes and activities responsible for product quality;
    - Compliance with established processes.
    
- *Evaluation of Product Quality 
- *Evaluation of Established Processes
    - audits for compliance with the process
    - if the process is not being followed the quality of resultant product can be affected
    - periodic audits - for compliance with the process need to be perform to ensure that establish process is being implemented

- determine if the product satisfy the specified quality requirement within cost and schedule constraint
- project management
- management must ensure that all quality evaluation activities are assigned to competent and unbias reviewers
- results are either quantitative or qualitative in nature assessment - subjective , analysis, audits, surveys and documents and project performance reviews
- quantitative - test, demonstration and metrics

**Considerations**
- **Quality Evaluation Versus Quality Assurance** 
- **The Concept of Independence.** Independence, as a concept, has two aspects:
    - Independence exercised within an organization, such as the use of a test team composed of individuals different from those who designed and developed the product; 
    - Independence exercised by establishing a separate group outside the project, such as an independent verification and validation agent from outside the organization that is producing the product. This form of independence is perhaps the most stringent.

-  how they will evaluate the product quality they offer

### Lesson 3: SOFTWARE QUALITY LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE QUALITY EXPERTS

Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of intelligent effort. — John Ruskin

**1. Kaoru Ishikawa** 
To explain the quality “miracle” in Japan, Kaoru Ishikawa offers six features of quality work there:
- Company-wide quality control
- Top management quality control audit
- Industrial education and training
- Quality Circle activities
- Application of statistical methods
- Nationwide quality control promotion activities 
![[Pasted image 20220923100049.png]]


**2. Joesph M. Juran** 
To meet the challenges of solid quality achievement, Joseph M. Juran prescribes the following:
- Structured annual improvements in quality
- A massive quality-oriented training program
- Upper management leadership of the company's approach to product quality

**3. Yoji Akao** 
With Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Dr. Yoji Akao provides a voice to the user. QFD should then provide views from three user, or customer, perspectives (known as Kano):
1. What the users can verbally express (normal requirements)
2. What they silently take for granted that they will get (expected requirements)
3. What the developers can anticipate will truly excite the users (exciting requirements)


**4. Edwards Deming**
W. Edwards Deming is the guiding consultant for the application of statistical methods to quality control as laid out by Walter A. Shewhart.
![[Pasted image 20220923100356.png]]

**5. Genichi Taguchi**
Dr. Taguchi has been using and teaching methods to reduce variability at Bell Labs and throughout Japan, Taiwan, and India from 1955 through 1980. The Taguchi Method shows techniques for reducing variability in products and processes at the design stage, thus enhancing their ability to overcome the many uncontrollable changing conditions in production. In the United States these methods are taught by the American Supplier Institute, Inc. 
    • Off-line quality control. 
    • Online quality control.

**6. Shigeo Shingo** 
Poka-yoke (in english, "mistake-proofing") looks at a defect, stops the production system, and give immediate feedback so that we can get to the root cause of the problem, and prevent it from happening again. Source Inspections looks at errors before they become defects and either stops the system for correction or automatically adjusts the error condition to prevent it from becoming a defect. Using poka-yoke devices and sources inspection systems has enables companies like Toyota Motors to virtually eliminate the need for statistical quality control (SQC), which has been the very heart of quality control in this country for years.

**7. Philip Crosby**
• Quality Management Maturity Grid 
• In the stage of uncertainty there are a number of deeply rooted “facts” that “everybody knows” about software quality: 
1. Quality means goodness; it cannot be defined. 
2. Because it cannot be defined, quality cannot be measured. 
3. The trouble with quality is that American workers don’t give a damn. 
4. Quality is fine, but we cannot afford it. 5. Data processing is different—error is inevitable


**8. Watts S. Humphrey** 
Founder of the SEI Software Process Program and a fellow of the SEI, has been awarded the prestigious 2003 National Medal of Technology for his contributions to the software engineering community. 
• CMMI 
• TSP 
• PSP
Software suppliers do not generally take responsibility for the defect content of their products. They often even ship products that contain known defects, and they commonly charge customers for a significant part of the costs of fixing these practices. Software is routinely blamed for common problems in almost  any industry that serves the public and the public has come to expect software to perform badly.
While today it may seem rational for the software industry to disclaim all responsibility for the quality of their products, this is tantamount to insisting that the market change before the industry will. This stance guarantees that when the market changes as it must, the public mist first be damaged. This will cause avoidable harm and discredit the present suppliers. Continuing with this strategy will mean that software quality will inevitably become a hot political issue.

Shingeo Shingo
- Japanese industrial engineer
- Leading experts on manufacturing practices and rthe Toyota production system 
- one of the greatest influences on Japanese quality control. His contribution to quality improvement revolutionized the Japanese industrial sector and influenced the industries in the west 
- shingo prize an award named after him
- ![[Pasted image 20220916130542.png]]
- He pioneered the concept of single minute exchange of die system in which set up times are reduced from hours to minutes. This allows the manufacturing system  to quickly adjust to the changing customer requirements and the production schedule 
- it is a two Japanese word. poka meaning mistake and yoke mean proofing.
- Poka yoke is a part of a system zero quality control or zero defects
- mistake proofing systems use sensors or other devices that make it nearly impossible for an operator to make an error
- prevent errors from moving on to the next step in the process by either warning the  person performing the process or controlling the process completely 
- Control type mistake  proofing system either prevent the error completely from occurring or when it detects an error it  stops the process. example is a form that does not allow you to move onto next field if you don't fill out the required field
- Shigeo Shingo developed an approach called Zero Quality Control (ZQC). ZQC, sometimes referred to as “Zero Defects,” is based on the principle that defects are prevented by controlling the performance of a process so that it cannot produce defects even when a machine or person makes a mistake. Poka-Yoke or Mistake Proofing is one key aspect of ZQC. Poka-Yoke or Mistake Proofing systems use sensors or other devices that make it nearly impossible for an operator to make an error.

**4 steps are to prevent the occurrence of human error**
- Elimination - eliminate the possibility of error by redesigning the product of process 
- prevention - engineering the product or process so it is impossible to make a error at all
- replacements - substitute to improve consistent
- facilitation employ a technique and combine steps to make work easy to perform 
**minimizing the effect after occurrence of human error** 
- detection - identify the error before the further processing occurs so that the user can quickly react and correct the problem
- Mitigation - seek and minimize the effect of error


## SCRIPT REPORTING [[2022-09-17]]
To reduce the prevalence of process errors, poka-yoke is based on six principles 

**The first four principle are to prevent the occurrence of human error**

1.  **Elimination** – the most preferable solution. eliminate the possibility of error by redesigning the product of process 

2.  **Prevention** – or engineering a product or service so so it is impossible to make a error at all for an individual 

3.  **Replacement** –  is substitution of a reliable process to lessen the chances of an error occurring

4.  **Facilitation** – employing a technique and combine steps to make work easy to perform 

**The last two principle are to minimize the  effect after occurrence of human error**
7.  **Detection** – or identifying an error before further process steps are undertaken. This allows the error to be rectified without further damage to equipment or personnel.

8.  **Mitigation** – the least preferable solution. Here, the aim is to minimize the effects of errors without necessarily solving them.

### Lesson 6: Training for Quality Management
Perspective of training for quality program element, evaluate process and product quality. 

**Context for a Quality Evaluation Training Program** 
• Quality Evaluation to Quality Assurance 
• Audience for Quality Evaluation Training 
• Organizational Training Program 
• Needed Skills and Knowledge


**Quality Evaluation to Quality Assurance** 
Quality program incorporates 3 elements covering activities
• Establish Requirements and Control Changes 
    - specify requirements for quality of the product
• Establish and Implement Methods 
    - put in practice methods, in processes and procedures to develop, operate, and maintain a certain products
• Evaluate Process and Product Quality
    - implement methods and processes to evaluate the quality of the product and associated documents that have impact to the product
    - QA functions depends on how organization defines their QA

**Audience for Quality Evaluation Training** 
The primary audiences for training in quality evaluation are those that implement the evaluation and interact with the following: 
• Requirements development; 
• Requirements management; 
• Process developers and evaluators; 
• Process and product quality evaluators.


- only tackles what's on the change logs. do not need to know the whole system
- scope of dicussion traanming for imoplemnting quality evalaition



**Organizational Training Program** 
The training needs for each organization varies widely but should have the following aspects: 
• Strategic training geared to the organization’s mission and business goals; 
• Training that is common across projects; 
• Training that meets needs specific to individual projects.
• Identifying the training needed; 
• Obtaining and providing training to address the needs; 
• Establishing and maintaining the training capability; 
• Establishing and maintaining training records; 
• Assessing training effectiveness

- Quality Evaluation Training set in the overall context of an organization's mission, structure, and training program
- To develop necessary skills and knowledge


**Needed Skills and Knowledge** 
• Organizations Goals and Objectives 
• Specific Project Goals, Objectives 
• Domain Knowledge 
• Quality Evaluation Requirements 
• How to Generate Criteria to Be Used in Judging Process and Product Quality 
• Limitations and Constraints on Performing and Implementing Quality Evaluation Functions 
• How to Write Plans and Procedures for Their Assignments 
• How to Do the Evaluation

- depends on needed skills and knowledge and what you assign

**Quality Evaluation Requirements**
There are a number of different types of requirements, including:
• Functional requirements;
• Performance requirements;
• Interface requirements;
• Data requirements;
• Security and privacy requirements;
• Data integrity requirements;
• The “ilities” (e.g., reliability, maintainability, and so on).


- what constitutes properly written requirements are important for performing this role


**How to Generate Criteria to Be Used in Judging Process and Product Quality**
• Training should be provided in the techniques for specifying the criteria for judging process and product quality. 
• Different types of products require different quality criteria, just as different processes will have different criteria.

- those who perform quality evaluation need criteria by which objectively judge the acceptability of the product or process evaluation


**Limitations and Constraints on Performing and Implementing Quality Evaluation Functions**
• Quality evaluators who work in the medical device industry will have very rigid constraints imposed by the FDA, just as quality evaluators working on commercial aircraft with consideration of safety of flight components will as well. 
• Quality evaluators who work on the software for commercial aircraft entertainment systems may have a more relaxed set of requirements. 
• Quality evaluators in all industries and application domains must be trained in the constraints, requirements, and limitations imposed by the policies, standards, and regulations applicable to them.

- do not just provide standards provide policies and regulations
- appraisal methodologies, CMMI


**How to Write Plans and Procedures for Their Assignments** 
• A quality evaluation plan or, more than likely, a set of quality evaluation plans, should exist for all projects. 
• There will be a set; for example, one for document evaluation, one for peer reviews, another for test, and so on. 
• It is important to know the appropriate type of content to include for each type of plan that must be written. 
• One size does not fit all in this case.

- author must be knowledgeable about the domain

**How to Do the Evaluation**
