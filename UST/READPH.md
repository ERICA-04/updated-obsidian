## Reporting notes
Datos - chiefs of barangay
barangay - e classed, by their language
three castes: 
- nobles, 
- commoners, and 
- slaves. 
**nobles** 
- were the free-born whom they call maharlica. They did not pay tax or tribute to the dato, but must accompany him in war, at their own expense

MARRIAGE
MAHARLICA + own slave = free all
maharlica + other slave = she was compelled, when pregnant, to give her master half of a gold tael, because of her risk of death, and for her inability to labor during hte pregnancy.. 
- child is free if recognized by father
- child is alipin if notr recognize

free woman + salve = all free

one person + one maharlica + one alipin = fisrt child belon to father. bunso is to mother. status of the child depend kung kanino siya mapunta
- one child = half free half slave 
- were an odd number of children, the odd one was half free and half slave.
- saguiguilir could be sold, but not the namamahay and their children, nor could they be transferred. However, they could be transferred from the barangay by inheritance, provided they remained in the same village.

kabit kabit tradition pg 4-5

THE WORSHIP OF THE TAGALOGS, THEIR GODS AND THEIR BURIALS AND SUPERSTITIONS
- **simbahan** which means a temple or place of adoration
- a festival, which they called **pandot**, or “worship,”
    - During this time the whole barangay, or family, united and joined in the worship which they call nagaanitos
    - celebrated it in large house of a chief.
    - celebrated it in large house of a chief.
    - with a roof, called sibi, to protect the people from being wet when it rained
- three compartments: 
    - On the posts of the house they set small lamps, called **sorihile**;
    - in the center of the house they placed one large lamp, adorned with leaves of the white palm, wrought into many designs.
    - brought together many drums, large and small, which they beat successively while the feast lasted, which was usually four days

Bathala
- whom they especially worshipped. The title seems to signify "all powerful," or "maker of all things."
Sun
- which, on account of its beauty, is almost universally respected and honored by heathens.
moon
- especially when it was new, at which time they held great rejoicing, adoring it and bidding it welcome.
stars
- some adored the stars although they did not know them by their names, as the Spaniards and other nations know the planets - with the one exception of the morning star, which they called Tala

"seven little goats" 
- (the Pleiades) - as we call them - and, consequently, the change of seasons, which they call Mapolon; and Balatic, which is our Greater Bear.
lic-ha, 
- which were images with different shapes

some particular dead man who was brave in war and endowed with special faculties, to whom they commended themselves for protection in their tribulations.

Dian masalanta, 
- who was the patron of lovers and of generation.
Lacapati and Idianale 
- were the patrons of the cultivated lands and of husbandry

paid reverence to water-lizards called by them buaya, or crocodiles, from fear of being harmed by them

They were even in the habit of offering these animals a portion of what they carried in their boats, by throwing it into the water, or placing it upon the bank.

augaries
- if they left their house and met on the way a serpent or rat, or a bird called Tigmamanuguin which was singing in the tree, or if they chanced upon anyone who sneezed, they returned at once to their house, considering the incident as ani augury that some evil might befall them if they should continue their journey
- This song had two different forms; in the one case it was considered as an evil omen; in the other, as a good omen, and then they continued their journey
- practiced divination, to see whether weapons, such as a dagger of knife, were to be useful and lucky for their possessor whenever an occasion should offer

date
- no established division of years, months, and days; these are determined by the cultivation of the soil, counted by moons, and the different effects produced upon the trees when yielding flowers, fruits, and leaves; all this helps them in making up the year
-  and summer are distinguished as sun-time and water-time-
- now since they have become Christians, the seasons are not quite the same, for at Christmas it gets somewhat cooler. The years, since the advent of the Spaniards, have deem determined by the latter, and the seasons have been given their proper names, and they have been divided into weeks.


feast or offerings
- The reasons for offering this sacrifice and adoration were, in addition to whatever personal matters there might be, the recovery of a sick person, the prosperous voyage of those embarking on the sea, a good harvest in the sowed lands, a propitious result in wars, a successful delivery in childbirth, and a happy outcome in married life. If this took place among people of rank, the festivities lasted thirty days.
- manner of offering sacrifice was to proclaim a feast, and offer to the devil what they had to eat
- was done in front of the idol, which they anoint with fragrant perfumes, such asmusk and civet, or gum of the storax-tree and other odoriferous woods, and praise it in poetic songs sung by the officiating priest, male or female, who is called **catalonan.**
- participants made responses to the song, beseeching the idol to favor them with those things of which they were in need, and generally, by offering repeated healths, they all became intoxicated
- some of their idolatries they were accustomed to place a good piece of cloth, doubled, over the idol, and over the cloth a chain or large gold ring, thus worshipping the devil without having sight of him.
- e devil was sometimes liable to enter into the body of the catalonan, and, assuming her shape and appearance, filled her with so great arrogance - he being the cause of it - that she seemed to shoot flames from her eyes; her hair stood on end, a fearful sight to those beholding, and she uttered words of arrogance and superiority

first period for girls
- their eyes were blindfolded four days and nights; and in the meantime, the friends and relatives were all invited to partake of food and drink. At the end of this period, the catalonan took the young girl to the water, bathed her and washed her head, and removed the bandage from her eyes. The old men said that they did this in order that the girls might bear children, and have fortune in finding husbands to their taste, who would not leave them widows in their youth
**distinction made among the priests of the devil were as follows:**
**catalonan**
- as above stated, was either a man or a woman. This office was an honourable one among the natives, and was held ordinarily by people of rank, this rule being general in all the islands.
**mangagauay, or witches,** 
- who deceived by pretending to heal the sick. These priests even induced maladies by their charms, which in proportion to the strength and efficacy of the witchcraft, are capable of causing death. In this way, if they wished to kill at once they did so; or they could prolong life,
- this office was general throughout the land.
**manyisalat, which is the same as mangagauay.**
- These priests had the power of applying such remedies to lovers that they would abandon and despise their own wives, and in fact could prevent them from having intercourse with the latter. If the woman constrained by these means, were abandoned, it would bring sickness upon her; and on account of the desertion would discharge blood and matter. This office was also general throughout the land.
**mancocolam,** 
- whose duty it was to emit fire from himself at night, once or oftener each month. This fire could not be extinguished; nor could it be thus emitted except as the priest wallowed in the ordure and filth which fall from the houses; and he who lived in the house where the priest was wallowing in order to emit this fire from himself; fell ill and died. This office was general.
**hacloban,** 
- which is another kind of witch, of greater efficacy than the mangagauay. Without the use of medicine, and by simply saluting or raising the hand, they killed whom they choose. But if they desired to heal those whom they had made ill by their charms, they did so by using other charms. Moreover, if they wished to destroy the house of some Indian hostile to them, they were able to do so without instruments. This was in Catanduanes, an island off the upper part of Luzon.
- **silagan,** 
whose office it was, if they saw anyone clothed in white, to tear out his liver and eat it, thus causing his death. This, like the preceding, was in the island of Catanduanes. Let no one, moreover, consider this is a fable; because, in Calavan, they tore out in this way through the anus all the intestines of a Spanish notary, who was buried in Calilaya by Fray Juan de Merida.
**magtatangal**
- and his purpose was to show himself at night to many persons, without his head or entrails. In such wise the devil walked about and carried, or pretended to carry, his head to different places; and, in the morning, returned it to his body - remaining, as before, alive. This seems to me to be a fable, although the natives affirm that they have seen it, because the devil probably caused them so to believe. This occurred in Catanduanes
**osuang,** 
- which is equivalent to "sorcerer", they say that they have seen him fly, and that he murdered men and ate their flesh. This was among the Visayas Islands; among the Tagalogs these did not exist.
**mangagayoma.** 
- They made charms for lovers out of herbs, stones, and wood, which would infuse the heart with love. Thus did they deceive the people, although sometimes, through intervention of the devil, they gained their ends
s **sonat,which is equivalent to "preacher."** 
- It was his office to help one die, at which time he predicted the salvation or condemnation of the soul. It was not lawful for the functions of this office to be fulfilled by others than people of high standing, on account of the esteem in which it was held. This office was general throughout the islands.
- who was a sort of bishop who ordained priestesses and received their reverence, for they knelt before him as before one who could pardon sins, and expected salvation through him
**pangatahojan,** 
- was a soothsayer, and predicted the future. This office was general in all the islands
**bayoguin**, 
signified "cotquean," a man whose nature inclined toward that of a woman

custom of the Tagalogs.
burying the dead was as follows:
- deceased was buried beside his house
- he were a chief, he was placed beneath a little house or porch which they constructed for this purpose.
    - and afterward laid him on a boat which served as a coffin or bier, placing him beneath the porch, where guard was kept over him by a slave.
    - In place of rowers, various animals were placed within the boat, each one being assigned a place at the oar by two's - male and female of each species being together - as for example two goats, two deers, or two fowls. It was the slave's care to see that they were fed
- . If the deceased had been a warrior,
    - a living slave was tied beneath his body until in this wretched way he died. In the course of time, all suffered decay; and for many days the relatives of the dead man bewailed him, singing dirges, and praises of his good qualities, until finally they wearied of it. This grief was also accompanied by eating and drinking.

Aetas, or Negrinos (Negritos)
- They dug a deep, perpendicular hole, and placed the deceased within it, leaving him upright with head or crown unburied, on top of which they put half a cocoanut which was to serve him as a shield.
- Then they went in pursuit of some Indian, whom they killed in retribution for the Negrillo who had died. To this end they conspired together, hanging a certain token on their necks until someone of them procured the death of the innocent one

infidels said that they knew that there was another life of rest which they called maca, just as if we should say "paradise", or, in other words, **"village of rest."**
- They say that those who go to his place are the just, and the valiant, and those who lived without doing harm, or who possessed other moral virtues.

They said also that in the other life and mortality, there was a place of punishment, grief, and affliction, called **casanaan**, which was "a place of anguish;

There were also other pagans who confessed more clearly to a hell, which they called, as I have said, casanaan; they said that all the wicked went to that place, and there dwelt the demons, whom they called sitan.

ghosts
- vibit; and phantoms, which they called Tigbalaang.
- had another deception - namely that if any woman died in childbirth, she and the child suffered punishment; and that, at night, she could be heard lamenting. This was called patianac
