### Software Audit Method
guide to be a responsible software related aduitor 

Software audit

An audit is usually conducted for one of the following reasons:
1. 
2. compliance pa ba? still following the standards?
3. f

**A software-related audit involves:** 
• The client, person, or organization that requests the audit; 
• The auditor or team who performs the audit; 
• The auditee whose work is being examined

**client (i.e., person or organization)** 
- is responsible for authorizing the audit and for defining the scope and identifying the requirements of the audit.
- The management of the auditing organization assumes responsibility for the audit and allocates the necessary resources to perform the audit.
- auditor(s) and the auditee agree on respective roles and responsibilities, they can improve communication, agree on findings, use the audit time more efficiently, and make the overall audit more effective.

**audit team** 
- performs the audit. The audit team is composed of one or more people. Normally, one individual is designated the lead auditor.
- summarizes the finding for every area
**lead auditor**
- responsibility to organize and direct the audit and to coordinate the preparation and issuance of the audit report
**auditee**
- work is being examine 
- part of organization


IEEE Software Reviews says, “The **lead auditor** shall be free from bias and influence that could reduce his ability to make independent, objective evaluations”. 

**The lead auditor is also responsible for:** 
• Determining the team size; 
• Briefing team members on the audit scope and areas to be audited; 
• Providing background about the organization being audited; 
• Assigning the workload of who will audit what areas; 
• Determining the audit schedule; 
• Notifying and briefing the audited organization on the scope of the audit and materials that need to be provided; 
• Ensuring that the audit team is prepared to conduct the audit; 
• Ensuring that the audit plan or procedures are performed; 
• Issuing reports in accordance with the audit plan or procedures

**The auditee is the party being audited and is responsible for:** 
• Establishing a professional, positive attitude about the audit among the members of the audited organization; 
• Participating in the audit; 
• Providing all relevant materials and resources to the audit team; 
• Understanding the concerns of the auditors and verifying their factual accuracy; 
• Providing a response to the audit report; 
• Correcting or resolving deficiencies cited by the audit team

audit 
- according to ISO 9001:2000 includes auditing for all types of standards, whether quality, environmental, software, or other. 
- Consequently, many audit methods are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">common</mark> no matter what type of system or market sector is being audited. 
- The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">differences</mark> are in some auditing techniques, objectives, and performance standards

**Types Software Audits**
• Software piracy audit;
    - not authorized distributor
    - To determine if the software on the organization’s computers is legal
• Security audit; 
    - system records
• Information systems audit; 
    - secure corporate assets and data
    - data breach
• ISO 9001:2000 software audit; 
    - quality of software
• CMMI® -DEV appraisal;
• Personal audit experiences; 
    - focus is the project itself
• Automated audits
    - not bias because you use a automated siftware to do the audit

Why is there many types?
- The reason for this diverse coverage is to introduce the reader to many types of software-related audits and what they are trying to uncover.
- This should establish a basis for the reader to understand the auditing field and how it affects software quality personnel.

**Software Piracy Audit**
- “Software piracy” is a favorite catch-phrase used by the Business Software Alliance (BSA) and the software companies it represents. 
- The Business Software Alliance (BSA) is interested in helping all software users ensure that they use only fully licensed software and are educated about the ethical and digital security risks associated with unlicensed software use.
- The BSA Web site wonders when was the last time you conducted an audit of your company’s computers to check for unlicensed software?
- Software & Information Industry Association’s (SIIA) Anti-Piracy Division conducts a comprehensive, industry-wide campaign to fight software and content piracy. 
- As a general rule, companies should keep all receipts from software purchases indefinitely, and they should purchase software only from authorized dealers
- The proactive campaign is premised on the notion that one must balance enforcement with education in order to be effective. 
- The Anti-Piracy Division even recommends a list of audit software to aid in this task
- The heart of compliance assurance is the auditing of the installed software aided by the use of the auditing tool provided the BSA or SIIA organization for your use.


**Security Audit**
- They are a checklist that give an indication of the kinds of steps that an organization should take in securing its computer and information systems. 
- It should always be kept in mind that security of information systems is not a static solution that can be fixed once
- Constant attention has to be paid to the issues, as the risks, the threats, and the things that have to be protected are always changing.
- Issues:
    - Backups 
        - addressed here rather than under information systems audit because a method to restore the system is an integral aspect of security, if it is breached
        - What information or data do I have that has to be backed up
        - How often should I back my information up?
        - What is an efficient and cost effective medium for backing up onto?
    - Antivirus 
        - extra safety
        - There are two important things to bear in mind: 
            - Ensure that your antivirus software has the most recent updates. 
            - Ensure that your antivirus software is configured to identify viruses by all means that they can come into your computer (e-mail, Web browsing, floppy disks, CDs, archives, and so on)
    - Firewall
        - filter incoming and outcoming traffic
        - Specific information on the configuration of whatever firewall you use should be available from the manufacturer of your particular firewall. 
        - If you have an always-on connection, you should realize that instant messaging and chat facilities offer an excellent opportunity for a hacker to gain access to your systems, and are also a route by which spam can be propagated.
    - Access Control
        - If you are not the only person who has access to a PC, it may be worth while considering implementing a log-on system. 
        - This can be achieved through specialized user authentication systems; however, simple use of the user name and password facilities in Windows products is effective. 
        - For larger networks and companies many additional considerations must be taken into account in order to maintain information security.

**Information Systems Audit**
- Ron Weber, the author of the classic book Information Systems Control and Audit, says that information systems auditing evaluates whether computer-based information systems safeguard assets, maintain data integrity, achieve organizational objectives effectively, and consume resources efficiently. 
- ![[Pasted image 20221017061419.png]]
- Auditing is a responsible task as it may involve accessing live systems, and assurances need to be made that there is minimum interference to the business. 
- The scope of the audit should be very clearly defined, and the entire audit process should be closely monitored and documented
- The information systems lead auditor must be sensitive to the following : 
    - All audits should be conducted only with prior approval of the management. 
    - Consult an advocate for all the applicable legislation—that is, if you do not want to be caught by surprise later. 
    - Ensure that one does not violate the software copyright in any form. 
    - Ask the accounts department how long they retain financial records. 
    - Ensure that there is no misuse of the information processing facilities by any person, insider as well as outsider. 
    - If you are traveling with your notebook PC where you have stored encrypted files, you may be breaking a few laws of the land
    - Ensure that the evidence is admissible in court. The quality and completeness of evidence is beyond doubt, and you are really able to nail the cyber criminal. 
    - Apart from adherence to procedural aspects of security, also ensure that periodic technical compliance checks are done. 
    - Access and use of the system audit tools should be properly controlled and these should not be available to users.

**ISO 9001:2000 Software Audit**
- ISO 9001:2000 requires that an organization conduct internal audits at planned intervals to determine compliance to the standard and effective implementation. 
- The organization must also ensure that the processes in place achieve planned results. This is accomplished through monitoring and, as applicable, measuring process performance through internal audits and measuring programs. 
- Concluding section 8.2 of ISO 9001:2000, the organization is required to monitor the characteristics of the product to verify product requirements have been met
- ![[Pasted image 20221017062911.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20221017062919.png]]
- Notice in Table 8.6 that there appears to be extreme repetition of the requirements. But upon sufficient reflection it becomes clear that that repetition provides a checklist of adequate coverage for the various aspects of what needs to be audited
- Clearly there are multiple tools involved in a development project and this repetition helps the auditor recognize that he or she needs to find tools to manage, develop, support, protect, and control software
- **ISO 19011** is The Auditing Standard & How to Conduct Your Own Audits for ISO-related audits. the former ISO auditing standard was replaced by ISO 19011 in 2003. However, at present the 2000 Version of ISO 9001:2000 still refers to ISO 10011.
- ISO 19011 describes the controls of: 
- **Requirements of auditors:** That is, their previous qualification and experience and the training that they must undergo before conducting audits. Also, their independence and ability must be considered. 
- **Requirements of auditing:** That is, how they must be planned, conducted and recorded. Also, what proofs must be gathered during the audits and what records must be kept of the audits.
- In order to perform your own internal quality ISO 9001:2000 audits, you need a number of things
    - **First, a trained, experienced auditor is needed.** Although not essential to the requirements of ISO 9001:2000, it is strongly recommended that your Internal Quality Auditor has passed an internal auditor’s course, which should be accredited by a reputable organization, such as RABSQA or IRCA.
    - your auditor should perform a regular amount of auditing—at least 2 days or more per month—in order to ensure that the training is developed by ongoing practice.
    - **Second, a written standard against which to audit is necessary.** All auditors must have a documented standard against which the audit must be performed. In the case of ISO 9001:2000, this would be ISO 9001:2000 and your own written procedures, instructions, and Quality Manual
    - **Third, something to audit is needed.** Another common failing is for auditors to begin audits before there are sufficient records to enable a meaningful audit to take place. This does not mean that your organization must wait for 6 months before conducting audits. It may be sufficient to conduct audits after only a few weeks, provided that there are adequate records for the auditor to check the entire process

**CMMI® -DEV Appraisal**
- “An audit is not a software assessment,” says the Software Quality Assurance Subcommittee of a branch of the United States Department of Energy.
- They continue, “A software assessment appraises software processes and identifies potential areas for improvement”
- The basic difference between an assessment and an evaluation is that an assessment is an appraisal that an organization does to and for itself for the purposes of process improvement
- **Assessments** provide internal motivation for organizations to initiate or continue process improvement programs. 
- An **evaluation** is an appraisal in which an external group comes into an organization and examines its processes as input to a decision regarding future business or for monitoring current business
- ![[Pasted image 20221017065337.png]]
- **CMMI®-DEV** appraisals is from the SCAMPISM Method Definition Document, version
- **SCAMPISM** A consists of three phases and several essential processes, as shown in Table 8.8. Each phase is described in detail next
- ![[Pasted image 20221017065500.png]]
- **Phase 1:** **Plan and Prepare for Appraisal** The sponsor’s objectives for performing SCAMPISM A are determined in phase 1, process 1.1, Analyze Requirements. All other planning, preparation, execution, and reporting of results proceed from this initial activity according to the phase and processes outlined.
- Because of the significant investment and logistical planning involved, considerable iteration and refinement of planning activities should be expected in phase 1
- **Phase 2:** **Conduct Appraisal** In phase 2, the appraisal team focuses on collecting data from the appraised organization to judge the extent to which the model is implemented. Integral to this approach is the concept of coverage, which implies (a) the collection of sufficient data for each model component within the CMMI® model scope selected by the sponsor, and (b) obtaining a representative sample of ongoing processes (spanning the lifecycle phases consistent with the model scope of the appraisal).
- **Phase 3: Report Results** In phase 3, the appraisal team provides the findings and ratings to the appraisal sponsor and the organization. These artifacts become part of the appraisal record, which becomes protected data in accordance with the Appraisal Disclosure Statement. The level of protection and the plan for the disposition of appraisal materials and data is determined in phase 1 in collaboration with the sponsor.

**Project Audits (Internal CMMI® -DEV/ISO 9001:2000 Audits)**
- Project audits from an organizational perspective are those that internal SQA personnel (often I sat in for SQA as an auditor) usually perform, but if appropriate, the organization process group or other organizational entities may be audited.
- Typical project audits are carried out by the local SQA person assigned to the project, whereas this project audit from an organizational perspective reviews the SQA’s work on the project and other random processes and artifacts.

**Automated Audits**
- An automated audit eventually includes an increasing number of new forms of audit evidence, which may include alerts from continuous monitoring/audit procedures, analytic contingency tables (e.g., if “event” occurs, initiate an additional audit module), or forwardlooking data from operations.
