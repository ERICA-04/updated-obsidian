- argument for kantian theory



-  Acting for the Sake of Duty and Acting in Accordance with Duty
-  We act despite our desires to do otherwise. For Kant this means that acting for the sake of duty is the only way that an action can have moral worth.
- his person is acting for the sake of duty and hence their action is moral.
- Â If they acted because of those desires they acted in accordance with duty and their action had no moral worth. If they acted for the sake of duty, and just happened to have those desires, then their action has moral worth.
