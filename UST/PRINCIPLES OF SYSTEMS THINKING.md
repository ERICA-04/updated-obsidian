### Stock and Flow
stock 
- increase and accumulates
- flow in/ input = increase
- flow out = decrease level of stock
- ![[Pasted image 20221015095008.png]]
- flow in -> stock -> flow out
- related to casual loop diagram
- Example
    - garbage flow
    - 5kilos per week 
    - 20kilos per month
    - flowout as of today since january

### Agent-Based Modelling

Why study complex system?
- so that when something goes wrong it can easily be detected and find solution
- important to decision making - predictions
- to predict, projection and learn from it
- one representation is numeric simulation/ mathematical equations

modeling
- give data and modeling but decisions are up to you and how you will take the result
- predictions are there to guide and help understand the system
- instead of real simulation, do modeling to decrease cost and risk
- like the chances of airplane crash
- weather

agent features
- cars
- ants
- corn

agent modeling
- looks into the behavior of agent 
- simulate in a situation
- ano reaction ni agent
- behavior-oriented modeling

simulations
- exaggeration of the real world to know what wil; hapen 

goal-oriented
- more of those who can make decision or change actions depend on goal or objective
