Digital ‘accessibility’ relates to the design of content (on the web or otherwise) so it can be used by everyone, inclusive of those with (varying) limitations of the following abilities:

-   **Visual:** Blindness, low vision and colour-blindness
-   **Motor:** Reduced ability to use a mouse, slow response time, limited fine motor control
-   **Auditory:** Profound deafness and hard of hearing
-   **Cognitive:** Learning difficulty, easily distracted, an inability to focus on large quantities of information or data

**Accessibility** is one facet of usability. Unless deliberately alienating users with such limitations, you cannot claim your user experience as usable until it is accessible

Here are some tools and guidelines which can also help you:

-   [iOS Accessibility Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/ios/) are a useful reference built-in accessibility features, accessibility APIs, and developer tools.
-    [Android Accessibility Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/) is equally a valuable resource for improving accessibility and integrating features.
-    [BBC Accessibility Standards and Guidelines](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/) also has some useful information to access about their standards and practices.
-  [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) provides results in real time for regular and large text.
- [nclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/) is a pattern library in the form of a blog, with a focus on inclusive design. Each post explores a common interface component and comes up with a better, more robust and accessible version of it
-  [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/) is a free colour blindness simulator. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux and demonstrates in real-time how people with common colour vision impairments see things.
- [ox Product Accessibility Guidelines](http://accessibility.voxmedia.com/) provide detailed, bespoke checklists for people with different roles within a project team.
-   [AXE Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-coconut/iobddmbdndbbbfjopjdgadphaoihpojp?hl=en) allows you to test accessibility violations using its inspector, though you will need to use Chrome.
-   [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](http://wave.webaim.org/) is an automated tool to provide guidance on where your site needs tweaking to improve its accessibility. While no substitute for real users, it can provide valuable insights.
- [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) provides design patterns for common interface elements i.e. checkboxes, tab panels, sliders, toggle buttons, toolbars etc.
