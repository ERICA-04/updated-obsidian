### Innovation Through Design: Think, Make, Break, Repeat

**WHAT IS DESIGN INNOVATION**

The world around us is becoming more complex and humanity is facing unprecedented global challenges. Using design for finding innovative solutions that can make a difference will continue to play a vital part in the economic, cultural, social, and environmental prosperity of our planet.

It is more than just making things look good. It's about changes that lead to a better world for everyone while maintaining the health of our planet.

It's a simple detail that addresses a large environmental issue. Many people see design purely as a noun, a design, which is a thing. However, it is far more than that, and when combined with a focus on innovation, design can offer a way of doing things differently.

Design is therefore both attention to detail and understanding the bigger picture. 

Design thinking and human-centered design play a pivotal role in translating problems into innovative opportunities. Ultimately you're trying to bring about a better product to improve on a user's life.

**Steps in Design Process**
1.  Concept - depth understanding of everything needed for the project. Brainstorm, sketches. creatives
2.  Design Development - actual engineering stage
3.   Prototyping
4.  Design Review
5.  Production Implementation- to factories and into market

The role of the designer has been evolving and it's going to continue to evolve, but we will definitely be at the forefront of some of the solutions that will enable people to have better lives.

**What does design thinking mean?** 
Well, a popular definition of this concept by Tim Brown is that design thinking matches people's needs with what is technologically feasible, and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity.

Design thinking enables the integration of people's needs with the possibilities and the requirements for innovative business success.

HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN
Tools in Design Thinkming Process
Personas
- Personas allow us to engage socially and emotionally with the needs of the user and to include their voice within all phases of the design process.

Extreme Characters
- Extreme characters are a great method for extending your considerations beyond the needs of the typical and conventional user. 

Within the design process, it is easy and very common to focus on a particular target group and type of user. Trying to understand their specific problems, needs, and motivations.

Storyboarding 
- storyboards are used to visually explore the interactions between people and products or services. These can be used to represent a current or a future situation. 
- Storyboards for current situations are effective for highlighting issues with current experiences. 
- Storyboards of future or possible situations can be used for evaluating early concepts with other team members or prospective users, and for communicating concepts to others. 
- Storyboards are like comics. They use a series of illustrations to tell a story.


TRANSLATING INSIGHTS TO INNOVATIVE OPPORTUITIES
This design approach enables businesses to rapidly explore possible solutions and refine the product's usability, and by taking into account the multiple perspectives of the users,  the business, and other stakeholders, products and services can be developed that create  real value for both customers and businesses alike.


HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN IN THE REAL WORLD
part of the human-centered design is understanding the experience and being part of insights. So, insights is actually using them and then trying to find pain-points and then in understanding the pain-points, you can create a better experience.

MAKE PHASE
Prototypes are then created to represent these concepts. A prototype is the creation of a tangible representation of an envisaged idea.

Low-fidelity prototypes are different to wireframing as they use tangible materials to explore how people could interact with the final product or service. This allows users to experience and interact with something close to what the final product will actually look like. In doing this, you can uncover what is easy to use, what doesn't work, and what aspects, if any, need to be improved.

Mock-ups are commonly used in industrial design and manufacturing processes to visualize the detailed representation of the envisaged product. They're made early on in the design process, and mock-ups are a great way to test ideas and get buy-in from internal or external stakeholders before you spend too much time developing a functional product.  They allow for the exploration of specific form factors, such as how users will interact with the design or the process. The design of a mock-up should closely resemble the final visual representation of the product. However, mock-ups are not functional, so they don't allow for user's interaction with the design.

Wireframes are line drawings that show the fundamental structure or functions of a product or system. They can be especially useful for expanding upon sketches. Wireframes offer a formal way for designers to think about and communicate to others what a design can do. Because wireframes do not act like a finished product, they are quick to produce and are very easy to modify, assisting with the iterative idea generation process.

Prototyping is a low-cost high reward activity that can provide insight into how your design will be experienced by its users. It reduces miscommunication between teams and helps you catch mistakes early.


IDEA GENERATION

DESIGN BREAKING

Fundamental approches to the brakeing part of the desiogn process
-   Designing with breaking in mind 
requires embracing failure. Instead of striving for a final perfect solution, the process focuses on creating multiple representations along the way. 

-   Evaluating designs with users -
ensures that people will understand how to use a product or service. This is referred to as the usability of a product. 

-   Assessing solutions against design principles-
is a quick and easy way to avoid fundamental design flaws. But it requires knowledge of those principles and a certain level of experience in applying them. With more experience it becomes easier to spot violations of those principles. 


Common evaluation methods include: evaluation workshops, walk throughs, heuristic evaluation and controlled user testing. 

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

The principles we'll cover are

**affordances**
- Norman describes affordance as the perceived and actual properties of an object that determine just how the thing could possibly be used.

**Constraints** 
- In developing design solutions, constraints need to be considered in order to reduce the number of possible actions and to avoid selecting invalid options. This is really important because if we select an invalid option, in the best case, this leads to an error message, which is frustrating. In the worst case, it might lead to fatal errors in operating a machine such as an airplane or a medical device. 
- Constraints therefore help us to ensure that there is as little chance as possible for the users to make errors. 

**There are different types of constraints**

**Logical constraints** 
- draw on our knowledge of how things logically work. 
- For example, if you turn a screwdriver clockwise, the screw goes in, anti-clockwise, the screw comes out. 

**Cultural constrains**
- draw on things that we learned from growing up in a specific environment. 
- For example, we know that in countries where cars drive on the right side of the road, we have to turn right when getting into a round about. 

**Physical constraints** 
- are the most common type used in design. 
- They're also referred to as "poka-yoke", which is Japanese and stands for error proof. 
- The poka-yoke principle was invented at Toyota and applied in the design of their cars. 
- For example, you are unable to take the key out of the ignition until the gear is in parking position. This prevents users from making errors by limiting the number of possible physical actions.


**mapping**
- It is used to describe the relationship between control elements and their effects in the real world.

**consistency**
- consistency ensures that once we learn how to operate an interface, we can apply the same to another interface.

**feedback**
- Feedback shows that an action has been executed correctly or if there was an error. 
- Feedback is also used to show what the current status is of the interface and which operations are possible, which is also known as feed-forward. 
- Feedback can be delivered through things like sound, highlighting, and animation.

Feed-forward in soft applications is used to let us know what will happen even before triggering an action.

FAILURE

Failing can be tough, but at the end of the day it's probably one of the best learning experiences you can have. Dealing with failure is part of a designer's job. It's only way to know what to improve upon. It's key to iterating and working towards, you know, an innovative solution in the end. So, I don't think of failures as failures

That's when we start to think about, well, where did we go wrong? 
How can we learn from that, and how can we take those failures and really turn them into something positive and something successful in the future.

ITRERATION
- failures become opportunities to learn and to do it better in the next iteration

We also learned that sketching is used early on in the design process to find the right design, while prototyping is then used to get the design right.
