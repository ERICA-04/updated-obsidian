FROM GROWTH DESIGN CASE STUDIES
#PychologyInsights
**Banner Blindness**
- Users have learned to ignore content that resembles ads, is close to ads, or appears in locations traditionally dedicated to ads.

**User Investment**
- By letting people "customize" their experience, you allow them to invest energy in your product for future rewards.1
- Ultimately, users that have invested in your platform are more likely to stay loyal vs. switching to a competitor.2

**Hick's Law**
- The more options there are, the harder it is for users to take action.1
- For example, every email here is an option for the user. Their goal is to decide which one is most important.
- That's why competing for someone's attention in their mailbox is so hard.1

**Labor Perception Bias**
People trust and value things more when they see the underlying work.1

People dislike waiting in general, but if your users have high expectations (e.g., money transaction, migration, analysis, reporting), they become skeptical if the waiting time is too short. That's why displaying a labor screen right after a key action can improve your UX.2

For "benevolent deceptions"3 (fake waiting times), there are important ethical rules. We cover them step-by-step in the bonus at the end of this story

**Familiarity Bias**

When introducing a brand new feature, try to use existing UX patterns or visuals to make people feel at home. We tend to develop a preference for things merely because we are familiar with them.

Availability Heuristic
We often misjudge the magnitude of events that have happened recently.

This happens because it's easier for us to recall recent information.1

I've heard of the virus before, yet this last piece of information takes precedence on what I know.2

### Confirmation Bias

We tend to favor and use information that **confirms** our previously **existing beliefs.** 1

Here, my thoughts are anchored with the _News_ I just watched. So a quick look at this map confirms my fears **while ignoring the facts...** (which we'll get to soon!)

Negativity Bias
We have a stronger recall of the unpleasant over the positive.1

When data has a negative connotation, you should avoid showing cumulative cases in your dashboard.2 It can amplify/alter perceptions.

#UXProTip
### Pattern Breaks = Easy Reading
Similar to visual design, copy needs **hierarchy** to facilitate the reading experience. 

When everything looks the same, it's hard to scan the relevant information.

In an email context, where most **people have a short attention span**, the pattern breaks become critical for retention. 1

### Sniper Link
It simulates a search query that only shows emails from your domain

### Build For 90% Of Your Users

**Your product is simple to use until it isn't.** You have to put as much effort into removing clutter as adding new features.

If you constantly add features for the 10% of power users, soon enough, the majority of your users will find your product hard to use and look elsewhere.

It's a tough decision to make as a product manager or designer, but with accurate data, you can **increase user satisfaction by decluttering** (or hiding from primary screens) what's not being used by the majority.


### Death To Duplicates

Offering different paths to execute one action can lead to confusion.

-   "Can I do something different?"

Users slowly build a mental map of your product as they discover new things. Make sure that map stays simple by avoiding multiple similar paths.

_*To Spotify's defense, I believe the "home" lists always change. However, that is a UX decision up for testing!_

### Design For Context

When designing screen by screen, it's easy to forget the context of how a user will use the product. Visual components such as pop-ups, keyboards, notifications, menus, can overlap unwanted areas of your screen and hide critical information.

UX Paradox: Optimizing For People Who Pay
There's usually a conflict of interest when revenues come from non-users.

Teams optimize for money, while the experience for real users deteriorates.

Instagram had the vision of sharing your world through beautiful photos... But it's slowly becoming a shopping mall.

This leaves a gap for other products to do the same thing in a simpler & ethical way and win users.1
