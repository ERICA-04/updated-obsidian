```ad-important

what's beneficial for a specific population may be just as useful for a broader audience
```
```ad-info
A lot of designers, when they get into doing this kind of work, really like the idea of working on things that affect a lot of people's lives.
```


#### Design across devices
Approaches
1. Progressive enhancement 
    -  means designing from the smallest screen to the largest screen. 
    - The progressive enhancement approach is also known as bottom-up designing, because you first design for the smallest and most basic version of your site, like for a mobile phone, and then embellish your designs for larger screen sizes. 
    - allows you to highlight the most important content from the start, and come up with a clear vision of how the website should appear on all device sizes and types
2. mobile-first philosophy 
    - means that we start by designing the mobile version of a product, and later adapt it to fit larger screens, like tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.
3. Graceful degradation
    - means designing from the largest screen to smaller screens. 
    - The graceful degradation approach is also known as top-down designing

 **Next Billion Users**
- billion people around the world who are accessing the web for the first time. As they become regular internet users, the chance that they will be using a mobile device is very strong.

```ad-tip
Mobile users are key to the market, and their influence continues to grow.
```
```ad-tip
you need to be able to think about the devices that users are most likely to experience the product on, and design with that device in mind.
```

To design effectively for a specific device, consider:
![[Pasted image 20230418213022.png]]

**Design with 4Cs in mind**
- **Consistency**
    - means having a uniform design, so users can expect the design to feel familiar across devices and products.
- **Continuity**
    -  means providing users with a smooth and uninterrupted experience as they move between devices.
- **Context**
    -  means designing for the needs of a specific device and the way in which the user will use that device in any given situation.
    - Designers have to think about the context of the user situation, and adapt the design for the way the users interact with each device.
- **Complementary**
    -  means taking into account how each device can make the overall user experience even better.

**dedicated mobile app**
- is built to live on the mobile device and is accessed through an icon of the phone's home screen. 
- Dedicated mobile apps are also called native mobile apps.
![[Pasted image 20230418213751.png]]
**responsive web app** 
- is an actual website that adapts to the device the user is on, and is accessed through a mobile phone's web browser.
![[Pasted image 20230418213912.png]]


#### Start the UX design process: Empathize
- personas
- user stories
- user journey maps

personas 
- are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of real users.
- Personas are key to the design process because they reflect the lifestyles of your real target users and give your team an idea of how to meet your users’ needs or challenges.
#### Continue the UX design process: Empathize
user story 
- is a fictional one-sentence story, told from a persona's point of view, to inspire and inform design decisions.
- A good user story is able to connect the personas you've created to a specific goal that the users would like to accomplish.
FORMULA
![[Pasted image 20230418220031.png]]
_As a_ _type of user_ _(who), I want to_ _action_ _(what) so that_ _benefit_ _(why)._

**user journey** 
- is the series of experiences a user has as they interact with your product to achieve a specific goal.

User journey maps help to create :
- obstacle-free paths for your users, 
- reduce the impact of designer bias, 
- highlight new pain points, 
- identify areas for improvement in your design.

#### Continue the UX design process: Define
This is when you use your research from the previous phase to determine specific, solvable pain points for your design.

problem statement 
- is a clear description of  the user's need that should be addressed. 
- Great problem statements are human-centered, while being broad enough to allow for creative freedom, and narrow enough to be solved by a design solution.
- Problem statements help create that vision

![[Pasted image 20230418222207.png]]
Eye gaze, or eye tracking, is an emerging technology that allows users with disabilities a way to interact with the device by using eye movements.

#### Continue the UX design process: Ideate
during this phase, you will sketch some ideas for implementations and interfaces that your user can interact with as part of your design solution.

**competitive audit** 
- is an overview of your competitors' strengths and weaknesses. 
- These audits collect information about what your competitors are doing, including what techniques are working for them and what techniques are not.

## WEEK 2: Creating wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes
#### Sketch paper wireframes
Wireframe
- wireframes help designers figure out how a page is arranged. 
- Wireframes also help designers envision how each feature of a product fits with the others and how the product will likely be used.

**Benefits of paper wireframes**

![[Pasted image 20230419213244.png]]
#### Build a low-fidelity prototype



#### Test a low-fidelity prototype
 **research plan** 
 - organizes and outlines every part of your upcoming usability study from start to finish.

insights 
- help explain what data means and what to do with it.

turn the observations from research into actionable insights: 

-   Gather the data in one place
    
-   Organize the data
    
-   Find themes
    
-   Come up with insights

## Week 3: Creating mockups and high-fidelity prototypes
#### Design mockups
#### Build a high-fidelity prototype
#### Test a high-fidelity prototype
Considerations for your usability study
![[Pasted image 20230420232447.png]]
## Week 4: Designing a complementary responsive website
#### Begin to design a responsive website
 use case 
 - is how users would experience your product design when trying to complete a task.

#### Create information architecture
information architecture, or IA, 
- is the framework of website, or how it's organized, categorized, and structured. 
- In other words, IA is a structured organization of content to help users understand where the information they want is located. 
- Effective information architecture is key to creating a seamless user journey.
- IA is the roadmap for users to get everything they need from the product you’re designing.
- is all about organizing the contents of your designs for excellent user flow. IA requires you to know the users you’re designing for and their goals, behaviors, and expectations about products like yours.


Importance of information architecture
![[Pasted image 20230422003517.png]]

sitemap 
- is a diagram of a website or an app that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. 
- Sitemaps are a great way to review all of the pages you'll need to design for your website.
- help outline the pages of a website you need to design and can help you spot necessary pages that you’ve forgotten to include, need to remove, or need to combine. 
- Sitemaps also help people who use assistive technologies navigate the product successfully.

#### Ideate a responsive website
Before you start sketching 
![[Pasted image 20230422004658.png]]

focal point 
- is a specific and distinct area of the website that captures the user's attention.

above the fold
-  refers to the content on a webpage that doesn't require scrolling to experience.
Common webpage layout
![[Pasted image 20230422005817.png]]
You can ideate using a few different techniques, such as: 

-   **Competitive audits**: Revisit the competitive audit you conducted earlier in this course. In particular, review your findings about competitor websites. What are competitors doing well that could inspire your designs? Where does your product design have the opportunity to do better than existing offerings?
    
-   **How Might We**: HMW helps you reframe a problem statement into questions that prompt you to come up with ideas for design solutions. If you want to learn more about HMW, revisit this video about [using How Might We to ideate](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/lecture/DNkpy/use-how-might-we-to-ideate) and this reading about [best practices for HMW](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/supplement/DjbCy/best-practices-for-how-might-we) from earlier in the certificate program.
    
-   **Crazy Eights**: Sketch ideas for eight different designs, each with a new idea for solving the users’ problem. For a refresher about Crazy Eights, check out this video about [using Crazy Eights to ideate](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/lecture/2WDML/use-crazy-eights-to-ideate) and this reading about [best practices for Crazy Eights](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/supplement/Jmoa1/best-practices-for-crazy-eights) from earlier in the certificate program.
#### Create wireframes for a responsive website
Some things you’ll need to consider while wireframing different sized screens include

-   Which features of the design are shared between the mobile and desktop products? Which are not?
    
-   What is the best screen orientation for your design?
    
-   What components can be added to your mobile designs to take the limited space into account?

#### Build and test a low-fidelity prototype for a responsive website
```ad-note
the reason we create prototypes is to test the functionality of your designs and identify problems related to the function of your app.
```

**usability study** 
- is a research method that helps us understand how easy it is for participants to do core tasks in a product. 
- You can conduct as many usability studies as you need to gather feedback, make changes to your designs, and improve the user experience.

Awesome work! Planning and conducting usability studies and applying the resulting data to your designs is an important skill for UX designers. Without a usability study and the resulting data, your design is more likely to overlook critical details that cause friction for users. By putting the design through a usability study, you’re able to identify parts of the design that can be adjusted to meet the needs of your users better. Improving your design by planning and conducting a usability study and implementing the data you gather will help you demonstrate your thoroughness as a designer when you add this project to your portfolio.

#### Create a mockups and a high-fidelity prototype for a responsive website
**Mockup should include**

#### Create a UX portfolio case study
![[Pasted image 20230422212715.png]]

Pieces of a case study
![[Pasted image 20230422212858.png]]

Case studies demonstrate your design knowledge, your ability to collaborate with a team, and your skill for following through on an idea from start to finish, despite challenges. Adding case studies to your portfolio will help future employers get a better understanding of who you are as a designer and how you work through the process of building a product.


s a reminder, each case study should include 10 items.

1.  Your role in the project
    
2.  The goal of the project
    
3.  Your target audience
    
4.  Key challenges or constraints you faced
    
5.  The research conducted 
    
6.  Your initial concepts or design strategy
    
7.  Sketches or wireframes
    
8.  Results of any user testing 
    
9.  Your final polished designs 
    
10.   The conclusion of the project and any possible next steps

## Week 5: Building professional presence
#### Learn about UX design portfolios
```ad-tip
I really focused in on the storytelling and the thinking like user experience designer.

What really defined how I got into the job was a curiosity to learn, and to grow, and to project myself as a ambitious visual designer.
```

#### Start a UX design portfolio

build your portfolio website: [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/ "Link to squarespace"), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/ "Link to webflow website homepage"), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/ "Link to wix website homepage"), and [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new "Link to google sites home").

To help you get started, check out this list of elements to include in your portfolio website. You might have noticed these tips in action when you reviewed examples of entry-level UX designer portfolios earlier in the course!

Name and personal logo (if you have one). Clearly list your name at the top of your portfolio website to help visitors easily identify whose work they are reviewing. If you have a personal logo, like a simple icon or a stylized version of your initials, you should consider including that alongside your name, too.

Navigation menu. Navigation is how users move from page to page on a website. Keep the navigation on your portfolio website simple and easy to follow. For example, users should be able to reach the homepage of your portfolio website from any part of your site, and your navigation titles should be clear and accurate.

Work samples. The focus of your portfolio website is to highlight samples of your UX design work. For example, you will create three projects during this certificate program that you can showcase on your portfolio website. When planning your portfolio website, be sure to choose a layout that will let work samples shine!

“About Me”. Plan to create a page on your portfolio website where visitors learn more about your interests, experiences, and passions. You'll create an "About Me" page for your portfolio website in an upcoming activity of the course. 

Contact information. On your portfolio website, it's helpful to provide information about how people can contact you. For example, you should provide your email address, a link to your resume, and links to your professional online profiles (like LinkedIn), so visitors can contact you about potential job opportunities. Wherever possible, try to use professional-looking naming, like an email address of [YourName]@gmail.com. You can plan to include your contact information in different parts of your portfolio website, like a dedicated page or across the top, bottom, or side of your portfolio website.

Color scheme. The colors in your portfolio can provide a more engaging user experience, and should reflect your personality and personal brand. We suggest selecting a small set of colors that work well together, like one primary color and one accent color. The goal of the colors is to support your content and personal brand, not distract from it.>)

![[Pasted image 20230423232745.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230423232859.png]]


A case study answers these questions. 
- What was the problem you were trying to solve? 
- What process did you follow? 
- Where did you succeed or fail? 
- What insights inform your design decisions along the way? 
- And what was the ultimate solution? 
- And why do you feel that solution was the best?

**Tips for writing portfolio**
![[Pasted image 20230424205701.png]]


#### Practice Networking
Networking 
- means interacting with other people to develop professional contacts and learn more about a job industry. You can network online or in person.

Topics to ask a mentor about
![[Pasted image 20230424212802.png]]


```ad-tip
She suggested sharing my work with the design community regularly to receive feedback. 

She also taught me that it's important to not just focus on what I can get from networking, but more importantly what I can give back to the community.
```

Impostor syndrome 
- is the belief that you're unskilled, inferior to others, or bad at your job, despite your successes.

```ad-important
Your success is not due to luck or help from others. 

Your success is due to your intelligence and hard work. 

```
```ad-tip
everybody's got something unique that they can bring to the table and value that they can add.
```

 Manage impostor syndrome
 -   **Acknowledge your thoughts.** Recognize how you’re feeling, and try to pinpoint why you’re feeling that way. This will help you figure out what triggers your impostor syndrome, so that you can better manage it in the future.
    
-   **Own your accomplishments.** You have your own unique perspectives and experiences. Think of all of the accomplishments and skills that make you different from the next person. Write them down in a list so that you can see just how much you have to talk about when you network. You have plenty to offer, so go into conversations with confidence!
    
-   **Be honest with yourself.** Do a realistic evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses. Finding areas that create the feeling of not “being good enough” and working to improve them will help you feel more confident in yourself. _Everyone_ has areas where they can improve, and there’s always more to learn, so don’t let your weaknesses hold you back.
    
-   **Have a conversation.** Ask a trusted mentor, friend, or seasoned professional how they handle impostor syndrome.
    
-   **Wear something that makes you feel confident.** Looking good helps you feel good. If you’re going to an in-person networking event, put on your favorite professional attire so that you feel like the best version of yourself.
    
-   **Help someone else.** Sharing the knowledge that you have with others helps you feel more valuable. This could be giving advice to someone less experienced than you or sharing a unique experience with one of your peers. If you think you don’t have anything to offer anyone else, refer back to the list you made earlier.
    
-   **Fake it till you make it.** Even if you don’t feel confident in your abilities as a designer, if you _act_ confident for long enough, eventually it will become second nature to you. People are naturally drawn to confident individuals, so acting confidently will likely help you make even more connections within your workplace and the UX community. 
    
-   **Go with a friend.** Attending networking events with someone you know can help you feel less overwhelmed and nervous.
    
-   **Get to know people.** Becoming more familiar with other UX professionals will make you feel less out of place. You’ll come to realize that experienced UX designers aren’t as intimidating as they may initially seem! This will help you feel less nervous in the future when you meet other people. 
    
-   **Know that you're not alone.** If you’re going to a networking event, or you’re starting a group project with people you don’t know, you won’t be the only one who feels they don’t belong. Being around experienced professionals can be intimidating, even if you’re one yourself! Plus, even the most experienced UX designers were once in your shoes. We all started somewhere.

## WEEK 6: Finding a UX job
#### Prepare a UX portfolio for job applications
**Portfolio tips**
![[Pasted image 20230424225240.png]]
identify mistakes
```ad-tip
The goal of your portfolio as an entry- level designer is to show potential. You want to prove that you have enough skills to do the nitty-gritty, sometimes tedious design work and that you're open to continuing to learn.
```

A **UX writer** creates the language that appears throughout a product, like websites or mobile apps.

A **UX program manager** ensures clear and timely communication, so that the process of building a product moves smoothly from start to finish. Program managers supervise, support, and keep track of the project as a whole. They assign tasks to team members, monitor the project budget, and manage timelines.

**UX researcher** conducts studies, interviews, and surveys to learn about the users of a product. Remember, UX research is all about understanding what users need and expect from a product. Research findings inform design decisions each step of the way!




#### Prepare for UX interviews
**first interview**  
- an introductory call with a recruiter or hiring manager to determine whether you meet the minimum set of requirements for the role.
- ask questions about the company and job

**second round of interviews** 
- usually explores your experience in more depth so that the team you're applying to can understand how your background fits the role. 
- They're a great opportunity for you to showcase your passions and highlight your strongest skills.


**panel interview** 
- is when a group of people meet with you at the same time to assess your skills. 
- The interviewers might ask you for examples of situations that demonstrate your work ethic and how you might approach problem-solving.

**whiteboard interview** 
- includes a practical demonstration of your skills in real time for your interviewers.

**Consider researching questions like: What's the company's mission statement? 
- What products do they have in the market? 
- How are those products designed? 
- What's the company culture like?

**PRE-INTERVIERW RESEARCH**
![[Pasted image 20230425212358.png]]

```ad-tip
title: interview
you need to know the narrative you want to share about yourself. Build a story about who you are as a designer, your personal brand, and reasons why projects were important to you.
```

**To prepare, ask yourself questions like:** 
- Is there a project in my portfolio that marks a turning point in my learning or career? 
- What challenges did I encounter during the design process? And how did I overcome them? 
- What did I learn from each project?

**During this first interview, the recruiter might ask questions like:** 
- What do you know about the company or product? 
- Why are you interested in the position? 
- What are your strengths? 
- Can you take me through one of your design projects?

**Some questions you might ask recruiters include,** 
- Does this position have room for growth? 
- How's the work life balance of this company? 
- What can you tell me about the team?

**Build rapport with interviewer**
![[Pasted image 20230425213514.png]]

```ad-important
that made me believe in them is their grit and the ability for them to seek feedback and their hunger for growth.If you find people, when I find people that are like, I may not know this, but I'm willing to learn, and I want to learn, and then tell me how, and I'm open to feedback
```

- who you are as a professional. 
- What are the things that you're looking for? 
- What is that one thing, or the role, the opportunity you're looking for that is going to make you super happy to wake up in the morning and go to your job?


#### Answer interview questions
![[Pasted image 20230425215651.png]]
-   Can you tell me about a time when you did your own research?
    
-   What part of the design process do you enjoy doing the most? Why?
    
-   How have you handled receiving negative feedback about your designs?

STAR METHOD
-  **S** is for **situation**. Describe the context around a particular circumstance, challenge, or event you experienced.
    
-   **T** is for **task**. Describe your responsibility in this situation. What were you asked to do, or what problem were you asked to solve?
    
-   **A** is for **action**. Describe what you did to meet the challenge or solve the problem. Give specific details that demonstrate your abilities in the job.
    
-   **R** is for **result**. Describe the outcome of the project or task. Give specific numbers whenever possible to make your results more concrete.

EXAMPLE
**Interview question**: Can you tell me about a time when you did your own research?
![[Pasted image 20230425220212.png]]
**Interview question**: How have you handled receiving negative feedback about your designs?
![[Pasted image 20230425220238.png]]

For this exemplar, the person preparing for an interview expects to be asked: 

_Can you tell me about a time when you did your own research to understand user needs?_

Using the STAR method, the person writes out this possible response:

_Recently, I completed a UX certification program where we were tasked with designing an app and website to help individuals limit their food waste._ (**Situation**) _The mock organization knew that people wanted to limit waste but didn’t know how to help._ (**Task**) _I reached out to interview participants in two categories: people who were already working to mitigate food waste and people who wanted to but didn’t know how to start. Through in-depth interviews, I discovered that the base issue revolved around understanding how long food (both cooked leftovers and fresh ingredients) lasted once it was in their fridge._ (**Action**) _That led me to develop a product that helped keep an accurate inventory of food that was easy to update and reminded users when it was time to eat something and how they could use it._ (**Result**)


“**Tell me a little about yourself.**”
-   Your educational background
    
-   Your first interest in the field of UX design
    
-   Your specific interests within the field, like interaction, visual, or motion design
    
-   Your training (like this program) where you’ve created original designs
    
-   The reasons you’re interested in this company and this job
    
-   Your past positions or current job that have prepared you for this role

**Experiential questions**
-   Tell me about a challenging (or successful) experience you’ve had in a job and how you handled it.
    
-   Tell me about a conflict you had in the past and how you resolved it.
    
-   Why should we hire you?
    
-   Where do you see yourself in five years?

#### Develop an elevator pitch
elevator pitch 
- is a short, memorable description that explains a concept in an easy-to-understand way.

![[Pasted image 20230425224639.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230425224648.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230425224620.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230425224625.png]]
There are four parts to a UX designer’s elevator pitch. Let's go through each one!

![Give an intro: an icon with an id badge that says, "Hello, I am..." with a person's face.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/NxjW_DZ_ToCY1vw2f-6ATg_976ae8f2074b49c39dc73342cc9170c8_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-9.57.04-AM.png?expiry=1682553600000&hmac=QS1assqFs4DuAGPaxe874HRfJmjHBpZhiWeHGIP1JUY)

**Give an intro (“Who I am”).** This is where you’ll introduce yourself and give a brief overview of your professional background. Tell the interviewer some of the job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first UX role, don’t be afraid to mention some of your past roles that are unrelated. You could say, “I’ve been working for over five years as a customer support professional and shift lead.”
![Describe your background: an icon with a magnifying a person's picture.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/nHiT0HRJToW4k9B0Sc6FAA_27bc3ca3831840f58cdfb0e84a6d314a_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-9.57.09-AM.png?expiry=1682553600000&hmac=-4chbj6QHJuhO08BZunhAfS2t94F8a4XOAxBe9yBEQw)

**Describe your background and state your purpose (“What I bring”)**. Describe your background and state that you’re a UX designer. Even if you’re interviewing for your first internship or job in UX design, it’s important to clarify that this is your career. For example, you could say,  “I want to apply my excellent customer service skills to design and create unforgettable user experiences for every person.”

![Show your excitement to work in UX: An icon with a user that has stars for eyes and is excited.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/x6aGDcBbQymmhg3AW2MpIw_32458051dd03452eb64b70c63680288e_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-9.57.15-AM.png?expiry=1682553600000&hmac=36B1qYQWICsatQhaEnRkYRl0oLds5P_f1P2zalLTY6U)

**Show your excitement to work in UX design (“Why I love the work”)**. This is where you share your passion for the field of UX design and why you want to work in the industry. If you’re motivated to make apps more equitable, mention that. Focus on why you’re interested in UX design and how you want to use your role to make a difference in the profession. This is a good time to talk about your goals. For example, you could say, “I love design that makes technology accessible for users of all backgrounds, needs, and experiences worldwide.”

![Communicate your interest in the company](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/5aqrv-CYQg-qq7_gmFIP-w_b4f35e8535fc4159bb482ae38027637c_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-9.57.20-AM.png?expiry=1682553600000&hmac=VvOtXg2S27x1wwfwIXHAstMeLlZcSDu6UY4gJENj7rE)

**Communicate your interest in the company (“Why I am here”)**. This is where you make clear that you want the job you’re interviewing for. Why is this job the right fit for you? And how will the company benefit from having you on the team? For example, if you were interviewing at YouTube you could say, “YouTube’s mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to be a part of that mission and provide outstanding design solutions for my favorite app.”

This might seem like a lot to say about yourself in 60 seconds, but if you prepare your elevator pitch before the interview, you’ll feel more confident while talking to potential employers. And confidence during an interview is a good thing! Practice it with a friend or family member, or record yourself giving your pitch to figure out what you should change or emphasize. 

## Examples of elevator pitches

To bring the structure of an elevator pitch to life, check out two examples of elevator pitches from UX designers at Google.

### Karen

Interaction designer, Material Design

I’m Karen, a UX designer with a background in design as well as business development. I’ve designed for a range of companies, including a design studio, startup, design agency, as well as a tech company. Currently, I’m a designer on the Material Design team at Google. My work on Material Design has been used by many internal teams and external clients. 

I’ve worked on a variety of topics, such as accessibility, enterprise, consumer, commerce, and more novel interaction types, like the voice assistant. I’ve been able to hone my interaction and visual design skills through working on a diverse set of projects and topics. 

I love working on experiences that address the needs of different people — it’s one of the reasons why I enjoy working on accessibility design. I thrive on working on projects that are not just about improving people’s overall experience with products, apps, and services, but also from working on complex and unfamiliar topics, which help expand my horizons.

Making information universally accessible and useful is part of Google’s mission, and those areas happen to also be a focus of my work. I’m thankful to have the opportunity to work on topics and projects that align with my personal career goals. 

### Erika

Visual designer, Google Assistive Learning

I'm Erika, a visual designer, UX designer, and systems thinker at Google, with eight years of user-centered design experience.

I like to think of myself as a design jack-of-all-trades, with an emphasis on visual design. My expertise is shown best through fine tuning visual details and identifying inconsistent patterns throughout the UX process.

I love to solve problems using human-centered approaches by always putting the user first, and that's why I love UX. I work closely with diverse users around the world to find creative ways for them to intuitively and delightfully use the products that I work on.

Working at Google allows me and my work to reach millions of people and help solve problems like the equity gap that exists in education though design. I genuinely believe in the good that Google sets out to accomplish with creative and innovative technology applications.
#### Ace whiteboarding and panel interviews

**portfolio presentations**
**Interview presentations** 
- tell the story of who you are as a designer and the rationale behind your design decisions.
The interview presentation section of the interview process usually lasts about an hour. In that time you will: 

-   Introduce yourself and your design background
    
-   Explore two to three projects
    
-   Conclude your presentation
    
-   Open the floor for questions

![The problem: an icon of a person looking curious](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/fiCT5F3BRPKgk-RdwRTyYQ_a1c6ce61a4a94e8daf9a5cc45346d56a_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.05.49-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=fnoHX1u32IqVgmg4CQRYv7a8S1OX5SMDVOjfnbVEW70)

First, answer the question: “Why did I create this project?” Clearly explain the problem that you set out to solve with your product and the goal of your designs. Be sure to include the target audience and a brief explanation of their pain points. 

![The design process: An icon UX designer building paper wireframes.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Oru16JUqTVK7teiVKt1SFA_bd5f90962a024aae88b3e632985e9b88_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.05.54-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=D_W0UW9PswbSLjRPIAum0Jc_q7fYI64LW2LxiS8o8qQ)

Give an outline of the decisions and steps you took to solve the user’s pain points and design the product. Include a few sketches, paper wireframes, digital wireframes, prototypes, and mockups of your design to explain every step of the design. The goal here is to show interviewers how you work through your design solutions. You may also include your research, design philosophy, and rationale to further elaborate on your design decisions.

![The impact: an icon of a bullhorn.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/2WWattHTQSWlmrbR03Elnw_69142a5ba3094a3d9f87609cd1544682_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.05.58-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=XqEzJ3DebhcUdnIiIh64l8TxyCnRvpNlCr4UB3peMdo)

Explain the impact your design had on the problem you intended to solve. Explain how you measured that impact.  Be sure to include the relevant data that supports your claims. 

![Next Steps: An icon of a designer making changes to a design.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/XnXxaKraR_S18Wiq2vf0xg_84d09a83281e40e880ddc42b4f9674cc_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.06.05-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=dMcKdfn1WVzUh69y2gbB0dhh073_XMO3jncNTEq0qgc)

Because the design process never ends completely, designers want to see that you continued to iterate your design. These next steps can include any additional research, like subsequent usability studies or the way that you facilitated feedback implementation. The case studies that you’ve created in this certificate program have not launched, so be sure to make that clear during your presentation. 

![Learnings: An icon of gears inside a head turning.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qYFDOYvLQCKBQzmLywAiaQ_d50b1550a8994dab9d2103e7ee8afdfc_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.06.10-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=_trjjX2uRF4GWML0WvQGIUEn6q_Cs0KGcLrhY1Yk6zk)

Employers want to see what you learned from your experience working on the project. This will give them a better understanding of  the type of designer you are, how you receive feedback, and how you reflect on and improve your designs.


**whiteboard interview**
- you’ll be given a design problem to solve in real time on a whiteboard, chalkboard, easel, or similar drawing surface

 Best practices for whiteboard interviews

Even if you’re getting ready for your very first whiteboard interview, you can be confident that with some preparation, you’ll do it well. Here are a few best practices to help set you up for success.

![do your research](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Bp3aWWO8QiCd2lljvDIggQ_c937dd2cf85a46e89a40e622a12fbef2_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.08.07-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=jPJg4Faas_lYzrXKv6xL3Moh34bq0VOFEWr0ZzNt6Vs)

A good way to prepare for the interview is to find examples of whiteboard interview questions and insights. There are plenty of resources for this online, like these articles from Medium’s UX Collective: the first describes [5 steps to master a whiteboard design challenge](https://uxdesign.cc/5-steps-to-master-a-whiteboard-design-challenge-6ecbe9ec38b7); the second explains one new designer’s experience with the [whiteboard interview at Google](https://uxdesign.cc/how-i-joined-google-as-a-new-grad-designer-and-what-i-learned-from-it-525d10c9b796). These resources will help you know what to expect, the types of questions you might be asked, and how you would answer if you were asked a similar question. Remember, there’s limited time for this part of the interview, so the work you show won’t be super polished. But that's okay! The main purpose of the whiteboard challenge is to show how you think and your approach to the UX design process.

![Practice thinking aloud](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wZkeSMFFSb6ZHkjBRZm-Kg_023dea46bc3843949a0ee2d6c4969626_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.08.12-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=JRY11jTGb5g6dM24ELdNrOt-ULvPf0MDwwC3tlT-630)

It’s important to make sure that your explanations are clear and make sense as you describe your decisions and explain your reasoning. You can practice this before the interview by saying your thought process out loud and then recording yourself. Try using one of the whiteboard interview questions you find online as practice, then listen to how you respond.

![Clarify your tasks: An icon with a checklist.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/QuRejYFmQL-kXo2BZkC_7A_8518f2ad4c7f481e845b7b660300357b_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.08.16-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=ZI0rv6Ex6cPU7ArSUzWXvxtEA7afdwuUiiDJMldBQdY)

One goal of the interview is to observe how you deal with ambiguity. Questions are often vague on purpose so interviewers can see how candidates approach the problem. So it’s important to clarify your tasks to show that you understand the design problem you’re solving for. After the interviewer gives you a task, begin by repeating that task back to them. This will help make sure that you understand what’s being asked of you, and it gives the interviewer a chance to spell out any details. You should also take the opportunity to ask questions to clarify instructions. 

![Show your process](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/nbJC9fu9SIiyQvX7vQiIjw_fa734f80ea874f988161438bb7a40770_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.08.21-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=RxHGW-XWK4tLNcYXgbupTSfvspLtIq02YF_wsa5r-8A)

It’s also important to show your process as you answer the whiteboard question. Think of the big picture and what you want people to know. Start by making sure you know who the user is and what their issues or pain points are. Then you can begin at a place in the design process where you feel comfortable explaining how you work to solve those issues. Remember, you won't have time to thoroughly go through the design process, but you can bring up empathizing and testing as steps you'd like to take with more time. Three ways to show your process include creating a framework, demonstrating teamwork, and clarifying assumptions.

![demonstrate teamwork](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Yel8L4bARJqpfC-GwJSaew_479bfdb468054d3ebfefde8fbdc7aaac_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.08.26-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=7fhfA18RRSfWeRVpMM8URBIQCYoJ5m-08552NfvemY8)

Take this opportunity to show how you collaborate with other designers and your ability to work in a team. Often during whiteboard interviews, there are other UX designers in the room who are part of the interview process and will ask questions as you work through your example. This is a good chance to show how you work with other designers, allow them to share their ideas with you, and find areas you agree on. By doing this, you demonstrate that you can work well with others and that the design solutions are based on more than one perspective. After you land your job, the ability to align with others on your team at the beginning of the design process will be essential to your success.

![ask questions](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Nt91u7lLT8ifdbu5S5_Ixg_c904a6c6ad584c88a97a8bcf7c3e0b6c_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.11.57-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=jFhw2BNH29hVDeUdQ2Y_UQ4cYuyDNKrSUIm8PqAvZMI)

Don’t be afraid to ask additional questions as you whiteboard. It’s okay to ask for more details about use cases, edge cases, or even the general demographics of your target users if you need clarification or more information to make solid decisions about your designs and demonstrate your thought process.

![Be confident](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-b9K5SKRRLS_SuUikWS0nw_362c11506a1e405c952e01b5488d4de8_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-10.12.01-AM.png?expiry=1682640000000&hmac=IOGHAPzkp0BtdfGwDS6LjER0rcYDP1W-r5NuJ4oevBI)

Don’t doubt yourself! This certificate program has given you the tools you need to prepare for the whiteboard interview. You know the thought process behind solving users’ issues: empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing. Just keep that process in mind, and be confident as you explain your approach. Remember why you’re on this career path and what you hope to accomplish in your career as a UX designer. It’s your time to apply everything you’ve learned!

**here's a list of common questions that your interviewers might be asking themselves during your whiteboard interview.**
- What questions did they ask before starting? 

- Do they know the user they're designing for? 

- Does this product design fit the guidelines given? 

- Do they think too independently, 

- or do they rely too much on the team's help? 

- Are they truly brainstorming or are they focusing only on one design? 

- Are they addressing the core problem of the exercise? 

- How well do they communicate as they design? 

- Is this someone who can work well on a team?

Let's review all you've learned throughout this program. You started by building a foundation in UX design, you reviewed common job responsibilities of entry level UX designers, and other teams you might work with. You learned common terms, tools, and frameworks, UX designers use. You explained why design sprints are an important and useful part of a UX designer's work. And you started to develop a professional online presence, including beginning your portfolio and joining online UX communities. Next, you started the design process for your first portfolio project. You empathized with users, defined the problem, and ideated on possible solutions. Along the way, you realized that understanding the world from a user's point of view is one of the most important jobs of a UX designer. That empathy includes a focus on accessibility, and is a key component to designing for everyone. After that, you  Sketched wireframes on paper, and created them digitally in Figma.

Then you moved into the prototype phase of the design process. You built your first low-fidelity prototype of an app, and you saw your designs in action. You also learned the importance of ethics in the field of UX design. You learned all about designing for websites, including sitemaps and common webpage layouts.
