Being able to effectively provide and receive feedback from other UX designers makes you a better designer and prepares you for a career full of ideation and iteration.
```

```ad-tip
title: peer feedback
Be respectful and kind, peer reviews work best when feedback is honest and the tone is respectful. 

Try using phrases like 
- I have a couple of thoughts to share or 
- I like what you've done here. 
- Have you considered or when I completed the assignment I found it helpful to.
```


### Empathize with users
```ad-tip
title: reminders to become a better designer
The best thing designers can do to create good user experiences is empathize.
```

**Empathy** means understanding someone’s feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself. 

**Sympathy** is the experience of showing concern or compassion without feeling the emotions themselves.

```ad-tip
title: reminders to become a better designer
By empathizing effectively with your users and doing your best to understand their needs, you build a great foundation for a product experience that will help solve their unique problems.
```

**Determine Research Goals**
To determine the goals of the interview, ask yourself questions like the following: 
- What do you want to learn from the interviews? 
- Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? 
- Are there any characteristics of users you want to interview? Why? 
- How much information should we have to ensure we get a comprehensive and balanced set of data? 

Write a clear list of goals to explain why you are conducting interviews, which will help determine the characteristics of participants who will be ideal for you to meet with.


As a UX designer, what do you want to learn from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with?

Here are some examples of common research goals when it comes to empathizing with users:

-   I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
-   I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
-   I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing.


**Steps that UX designers** follow when they plan research and interviews in the real world. You'll:

-   Create research goals that will guide the questions you ask and the designs you make later in the program.
-   Determine your target audience for the app you're designing.
-   Write out interview questions that you will use in later activities to "interview" fictional users.


Step 1: Determine research goals

Step 2: Define your target audience

Step 3: Write interview questions


**Screener survey or simply screener** 
- for short, is a detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet the requirements of the research study.

**Representative sample**
- is a subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group.

```ad-tip
title: email template to remind schedule interview
![[Pasted image 20220815180240.png]]
```

**Steps for conducting a user interview**
1. Meet the participants
	- Build a good rapport
	- Thank the participants for coming
	- Review legal details
	- Gather basic details
	- Let particpants know there are no right and wrong answers
2. Conduct Interview
3. Take notes
4. Wrap up the interview

### Empathy maps
- By the end of my interviews, what started off as stand-alone pain points comes together to create a better understanding of what needs to happen to improve the product.
 - Empathy maps are easily understood charts that explain what UX designers have learned about a particular type of user. 
 - Empathy maps can help break down each interview into digestible pieces of information.
 - An empathy map consists of four squares, which show what the user says, does, thinks, and feels.
 - 

**Types of Empathy maps**
**One-user empathy maps**
- One-user empathy maps are created by taking the data from one user's interview and turning it into an empathy map, like the example earlier in this reading. This approach helps designers distill a single user's thoughts, feelings, and traits into a format that's easier to gather data from.

**Aggregated empathy maps** (also known as "multiple-user empathy maps").
- Aggregated empathy maps represent a visualization of everything designers know about an entire user segment or group of similar users, not just one user.
- an aggregated empathy map, represents a group of users who share similar thoughts, opinions, or qualities. 
- Aggregated empathy maps are created by creating multiple one-user empathy maps, then combining the maps where users expressed similar things into a new empathy map. This helps designers identify segments, or groups of people with similar tendencies, who will use the product. The insights in aggregated empathy maps allow designers to identify themes, which helps them better empathize with the groups they are designing for.

### Identify user pain points
Saturday, August 13th 2022

- As a UX designer, empathizing is your number one superpower  because it helps you <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">spot user problems.</mark> 

- You need to do research to get into the user's head and understand where they're coming from.

- UX design is all about the user. You're always, always designing for the user. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">But who is the user and what are their struggles?</mark> 

- UX designer does into a single role,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> that role would be problem-solver,</mark>  and solving user struggles or pain points is number one on the list. 

- **Pain points** are any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need.

**Types of Paint Points**
	**Financial**
		- If you've ever gotten lost in an online article, only to be rudely interrupted by a paywall. 
		- or money-related pain points.
	**Product** 
		- These are usually quality issues related to the product. Norman Doors fall into this category. 
		- which are pain points related to quality issues.
	**Process** 
		- These are frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B. For example, have you ever shopped online and struggled to get the item you want to check out? and that could mean the business loses a customer.
		- which are pain points related to the user’s journey.
	**Support** 
		- When users interact with your product, they might have questions. If they can't find answers to their questions, they won't feel supported. Customer service information that's hidden on a website falls into this category.
		- which are pain points related to getting help from customer service. ^98dba1


**Brain + Heart = User Experience**


**Empathy maps** show us what the user thinks, says, does, and feels. Empathy maps help us get into the user's mindset, allowing us to identify their pain points.

### Create Personas
**Personas** are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Personas can help us identify patterns of behavior in users. These patterns might point to a common pain point that a group of users experiences.

A **user group** is a set of people who have similar interests, goals, or concerns

- Personas build empathy and put a face to the user. 
- They help humanize our users. 
- They give stakeholders a clearer idea of who their users really are and makes the user experience more meaningful personas tell stories. 
- This is why personas are key to turning an average stakeholder presentation into a story telling experience.
- diversity of their user groups
- Personas make sure we designers create something that benefits a wide range of users
- Personas are based from data and should be validated.
- persona is a fictional representation inspired by a group of interviews and not an exact reflection of any single individual.

**Benefits of Personas**
- Build empathy
- Tell stories
- Stress-test designs


**Personas** are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. Each persona that you create will represent a group of users with similar characteristics that you’ve learned about through your research. Personas are key to the design process because they reflect the lifestyles of users and give your team an idea of how to meet users’ needs or challenges.

## Week 2: Creating user stories and user journey maps
Date Started: August 17, 2022
Date Completed: August 18, 2022
### Craft user stories
**user stories** 
- which are fictional, one sentence stories that connect the needs of a potential user to a specific action and benefit.
- is a fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.
- It introduces the user, lays out an obstacle, and states their ultimate goal.
- it can be called scenarios or user cases
- User stories can also serve as a “checklist” to make sure you’re addressing and solving the key problems your users might face when engaging with your product.
- Different users have different needs, so be sure to practice empathy and keep their unique needs in mind when writing user stories.

**user journey maps**
- a tool used by UX designers to understand the obstacles a user faces while interacting with a product.

Advantages of user stories
- Prioritize designs goals
	- If you have a lot of user needs to consider, user stories, determine which ones are the most critical to resolve.
- Unite the 
	- User stories also unite the team around a clear goal.
- Inspire emphathetic design decisions
	- A good user story can also inspire empathetic design decisions by making our approach user-centered, also known as user-centric.
- Personalize pitches to stakeholders
	- You aren't just presenting your design update ideas. You're demonstrating how the updates will help specific types of people.

User stories composed of
- Hero
- Ultimate goal
- Conflict

```ad-important
title: **Simple formula** to write a user story and keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear.
As a [type of user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]. 

```

- **Type of user describes** who we are designing for. 
- **Action** is what the user hopes will happen. 
- **Benefit** is why the user wants the action to happen.

Examples:
- As an online shopper, I want to receive a text when the item arrives so that I can pick it up right away.
- As a frequent traveler, I want to hire a consistent dog walker so that I can feel comfortable about the safety of my pets while I'm on vacation.
- As a dog owner, I want to trust my dog walker so I can hire them for regular dog walks.
- As a busy executive, I want to trust that dog walkers won't stand me up so I can work worry-free.
- As an indecisive student, I want to try many walkers so I can pick one for regular walks.

### Consider edge cases
**Happy path**
- When building a new or improved product, the designer's goal is to keep all users on the happy path. 
- The happy path describes a user story with a happy ending. 
- For this user, everything goes as they expect and they reach their goal without issue.

**Edge case users**
- After all that work, has to close the website and find another way to get flowers for her friend. In the design world Iyla and others like her are called edge case users.
- An edge case is a rare situation or unexpected problem that interrupts a standard user experience. 
- Good UX anticipates edge cases and reroute users back to the happy path when things don't go as planned.
-  the obstacle is often beyond the user's control to fix.
- Identifying those cases is really key to creating a harmonious experience when things don't go the way that you plan for them to.

**Spotting and resolving edge cases**
**Pro tip 1: create personas and user stories.** If UX designers make sure their personas and user stories account for a wide variety of users and problems, they can keep even the most vulnerable users on the happy path. 

**Pro tip 2: thoroughly review the project before launch.** In the rush to launch a product, UX designers might focus only on the happy path. Giving the project of final good review from the user's perspective, helps designers identify edge cases. 

**Pro tip 3: use wireframes.** You'll learn how to create wireframes later. Wireframes help visualize the project, which makes it easier to identify potential user pain points and fix them before launch for folks who are not visually impaired.

```ad-tip
title: Tip to become a better designer
As a UX designer, you want to be that friend to all users. You want to be able to anticipate what needs they might have, whether they're on the happy path or not.
```


### User a journey map
User Journery
- A user journey is the series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal. 
- User journeys built off the personas and stories you've already created. hey help you think and feel like the user, which is super important.
- an illustration of what the user goes through to achieve their goals.
- persona is your character, the user story is your plot, and the journey map is your story outline.

**Benefits of user journey mapping**
- Helps UX designs create obstacle-free path
- Reduces impact of desigers bias
- Highlights new pain points
- Identifies improvement opportunities

**the user journey maps meet the following criteria:**

-   All of the actions along the user’s journey are defined.   
-   2-3 tasks are captured for each action.
-   The user's feelings are indicated at each point in their journey. 
-   Improvement opportunities are identified for each step of the user's journey.
-   The user journey maps consider accessibility and explore ways to reduce the impact of designer bias.

```ad-tip
title: Making user journey
**Some tips to consider:**

1.  Think about some real-world examples to help you understand how a user uses a product or service like yours.
    
2.  Include both positive and negative experiences.
    
3.  Think of opportunities that will improve negative experiences and build upon positive ones.
    
4.  Check along the way for opportunities to consider accessibility and avoid bias.

**As you work through creating your user journey map, keep the following in mind:**

-   Does your user journey map help your company’s UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users?
    
-   Did you explore ways to reduce the impact of designer bias?
    
-   Where did you incorporate accessibility and inclusive design when building the user journey map?
    
-   Were possible pain points highlighted?
```



### Accessibility
- accessibility is not just designing to include a group of users with varying abilities. Instead, it extends to anyone who is experiencing a permanent, temporary, or situational disability.
- is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. 
- Designing for accessibility is about considering all users’ journeys, keeping their permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities in mind.
- Accessibility improvements often enhance the design experience for all users. 
- As a result, it's an essential part of the design process to be inclusive of users with disabilities. It has the additional benefit of creating a stronger overall experience for everyone.


**Touch: How would you design for users who have use of one arm, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?**

- Decide where to place buttons within your design based on several different hand sizes.

- Create a feature that allows double taps to avoid accidental icon clicks.

- Enable the one-handed keyboard feature and general keyboard compatibility.

- Allow button customization for easy access to information that the user finds most important.

Permanent - One arm
Temporarily - Injured
Situational - New parent

See: How would you design for users who have limited vision, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?

- Use a larger font to create a reader-friendly design of the app.

- Ensure the app and the images have alternate text that can be read by a screen reader.

- Detect whether the user is operating a motor vehicle.

- Design the app with high contrast colors.

- Don’t rely on text color to explain navigation or next steps. For example, don’t use red text alone as an indicator of a warning. Instead, your design should include explicit instructions.

Permanent - Blind
Temporarily - Wear glasses
Situational - Distracted driver

Hear: How would you design for users who have limited hearing, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 

- Don’t rely solely on sounds to provide app updates, like a new message notification. Instead, enable haptics, which are vibrations that engage a user’s sense of touch, and notification lights.

- Apply closed captioning to all videos. 

- Provide a text messaging system within the app to allow users to communicate through writing.

Permanent - Deaf
Temporarily - Ear infection
Situational - Bartender

Speak: How would you design for users who cannot speak, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 

- Provide written intros, descriptions, and instructions for users, in addition to video-based content.

- Provide Real-Time Texting during phone calls with users or with app support.

- Arrange alternatives for automated systems that rely on speech recognition.

- Provide an in-app messaging system that allows the use of emojis and image uploads.

Permanent - Nonverbal
Temporarily - Laryngitis
Situational - Non-native speaker

```ad-tip
title: to become a better designer
To put inclusive design into practice, it’s important to immerse yourself in the assistive technology that people with disabilities might use and to have conversations with them about their experiences. The best way to design empathetically for the world around you is to engage with your users and ask them questions about the way your designs could help them succeed.
```

**Curb-cut effect** 
- is a phenomenon that describes how products and policies designed for people with disabilities often end up helping everyone.

**END OF WEEK 2**


## Week 3: Defining user problem
Date Started: August 22, 2022
Date Completed: August 23, 2022
### Define problem and hypothesis Statements
```ad-info
title: Design thinking process
**Empathize phase** - everything before this. helo us define th problem
		- research goals, target audience and questions
		- interviews
		- surveys
		- user bios
		- pain points
		- empathy map
		- persona
		- user story
		- user journey
**Define/Design phase** - is the week 3 - exist to solve user's problems
**Ideate
Prototype
Test**
```

**Problem Statement**
- is a clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed. 
- Problem statements align the team on which user problem to focus on, giving everyone a clear goal. 
- A strong problem statement is human-centered. 
- It should be broad enough to allow for some creative freedom, but narrow enough that it can actually be solved by a design solution. 
```ad-tip
title: **Problem statements can be written using a simple formula.**
USERNAME is a USER CHARACTERISTICS who needs USER NEED because INSIGHT

Examplae:
Amal is a athlete who needs to sign up for workout classes because the class he wants to participate in fills up fast


```

Effective problem statement
- establish goals - focus on the same thing
- unserstand constraints - what keeping users satisfied their needs
- define deliverables - what the solution will produce
- create benchmarks for success - how will we know when we succeed? 


**pain points** 
- are any UX issue or friction that frustrates the user and blocks them from getting what they need. 
- Minimizing pain points keeps users happy and encourages them to keep interacting with the product.

![[Course 2#^98dba1]]

**To build a problem statement, you can utilize the 5 Ws framework.**
- After you define the user’s pain points, you can answer who, what, when, where, why, and how to solve the user’s problem.

- **Who** is experiencing the problem? Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.

- **What** are the pain points you’re trying to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.

- **Where** is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.

- **When** does the problem occur? Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings. 

- **Why** is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.

- **How** are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

Example

Who: A busy executive

What: Arnold wants to hire a daily dog walker for his three dogs. 

Where: Arnold is likely using the app at work, on the go. 

When: Arnold gets frustrated when he opens the app, starting from the very beginning of the user journey. 

Why: Arnold doesn’t have a lot of experience with phone apps or similar technology. 

How: Arnold wants to go easily from the home screen of the app to the list of dog walkers to the confirmation screen.


Problem Statement from the framework
- Arnold is a busy executive who needs an easy app experience to hire a dog walker because he's not technologically savvy.
- The user, Avery, is a fine arts enthusiast that lives in a major city. Avery goes to museums several times a month. Avery wants an easy way to secure timed museum tickets. Avery wants to buy tickets on their smartphone, while on-the-go exploring the city on weekend afternoons.

Activity:
App: Obsidian
Who is experiencing the problem?
A working student

What is the problem?
She wants to have systematic note-taking of everything she does on a daily basis such as academic notes, work notes, random ideas, links, and tasks to stay productive and track her goals.

Where does the problem show up?
She uses the app at home since she takes online school and works from home.

When does the problem occur?
When she cannot find the note she needs and she cannot remember important task

Why is the problem important?
She is a young adult who needs an assistant in organizing her documents from important to notes in a single app.

```ad-important
title: Problem Statement Steps
1. define user's pain points
2. categorize pain points
3. apply 5Ws and H framework
4. apply the formula
```


Hypothesis
- an educated guess about how to solve the problem. 
- In UX design, we write possible solutions to the problem as hypothesis statements. 
- A hypothesis statement writes out our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design problem might be.
- time to consider how your designs can alleviate their pain points.
- Hypothesis statements help you narrow down your research insights into goals for your product, so you can stay focused on the wants and needs of your users.
- NO STANDARD FORMULA

Example structure
If/then statement:
- If / then statements focus directly on the needs of users.
- If NAME AND ACTION then NAME AND OUTCOME
- If Amal downloads the gym's app, then he can reserve his favorite class in advance.
-   **If** Tobias signs up for the dog walker app, **then** they will quickly and easily pick a walker that fits their schedule.

We believe format
- we believe statements take the perspective of your team into account, while remaining empathetic to the needs of users.
-   **We believe that** a simplified mode of the dog walker app **for** Arnold **will** allow them to hire dog walkers efficiently.
-   **We believe that** easy access to available dog walkers **for** Tobias **will** increase the amount of walks they choose for their pets.

Something more flexible:
- Amal needs an app that allows him to reserve his favorite classes in advance and notifies him of the first opportunity to sign up.

### Create a value proposition
- Now that you've had some time to think about what your users need, it's important to start thinking about how your product meets those needs.
- A value proposition is the reason why a consumer should use a product or a service. 
- you can think of this statement as the reason users will be interested and willing to engage with your product. 
- Value propositions ensure that users have a reason to use the product that you are creating, as opposed to any other product currently available.
- is like the list of all the feature of your app
- Having more categories and users allows you to tailor each value proposition to the user's needs.
- One of the most important things to know about value propositions is that they need to be short, clear, and to the point.


Example from the gym app:
Here are a few other things that our app could do. 
- Easy access to book private trainers. 
- Reservations for popular machines. 
- Make music requests in the gym. 
- On-demand videos for in-home exercises. 
- Sign up for workout classes. 
- Track workouts on the app via fitness devices. 
- Now, that you have a list of possible features for the app, you can sort these features into a category.


**STEPS IN CREATING VALUE PROPOSITION**
To start, you need to do some research in order to answer these two questions:
- What does your product do? 
	- Clearly explain the offering that your product provides users.
- And why should the user care? 
	- Describe how your product addresses users’ pain points.
**Step 1. Describe your product’s features and benefits.** Create a list of all the great features and benefits of your product, big and small. Don’t hold back; list everything that comes to mind and then narrow it down later.
![[Pasted image 20220822233312.png]]
**Step 2. Explain the value of the product.** Anything that you identify as a value proposition needs to be beneficial to your users. In this example, for the dog walker app, there were four categories of product values that were identified during user interviews: accessible, professional experience of the dog walkers, cost, and reliability. The giant list of features and benefits from step one is sorted into those four categories.
![[Pasted image 20220822233329.png]]
There were a few features and benefits from the original list that didn't fit into these four categories and didn't add real “value” for the users: 

-   Monthly organic goodies and new products for your pets
-   Exclusively for dog walking (no other kinds of pets)
-   Rating system for walkers
-   Training tips

These features and benefits were not sorted into the four categories and were instead set to the side.

**Step 3. Connect these features and benefits with the needs of your users.** The goal is to identify what’s truly valuable to the user and not just a cool feature that users didn’t ask for. To determine value, take the personas you’ve developed and pair each persona with a value proposition that meets their biggest pain point.

![A wall with different people's pictures and a sticky note underneath.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/EAuzleD8TPyLs5Xg_Fz8yQ_6d8ff9a34ce54df49406612e80a8f02d_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-7.29.15-AM.png?expiry=1661299200000&hmac=uzBlkwWoHwfteL49CBOPlBhUowv3e6dYmKUnGJcb2pA)
**Step 4. Review your official value proposition list.** You’ve narrowed your list down of lots of benefits and features by matching them with actual user needs. Now it’s time to review the list of value propositions your product offers. For the dog walker app, here are the value propositions that matched with the personas that were developed earlier:

**Identify your app’s unique value proposition.** 
- This means reviewing the list of value propositions that match to your personas and removing those that your competition also offers.
```ad-tip
title: to become a better designer
UX designers  wants to create products that provide a clear value for users.
```
```ad-info
title: key takeaways
- Users want to be able to easily identify exactly how your product will meet their unique needs and what sets your product apart in the market. 
- Sometimes users won’t know what they need until you explain it to them. 
- That’s the real heart of product design innovation.

### Explore the influence of pyschology in UX design
**Understand human factors**
- design to fit humans
**human factor**
- The human factor describes the range of variables humans bring to their product interactions.

**Common human factors that inform design**
- impatience
- limited memory
- needing analogies
- limited concentration
- changes in nedd
- needing motivation
- prejudices
- fears
- making errors
- misjudgement

**Pychological concepts that can help design with the human factor** 
**Mental models**
- internal maps that allow humans to predict how something will work
**Feedback loops**
- the outcome a user gets at the end of a process
- switches, switching positive feedback is ligths on negative is no lights

```ad-info
When UX designers turn limitations into opportunities, the human factor isn't so limiting after all.

```

**Psychological phenomena.** 
**Von Restorff effect or isolation effec**
- states that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
**serial position effect**
- says that when people are given a list of items, they are more likely to remember the first few and the last few, while the items in the middle tend to blur. 
- This is why most applications and websites position the most important user actions toward the far right or far left of a top navigation bar.
**Hick's law,** 
- states that the more options a user has, the longer it takes for them to make a decision. We can experience Hick's law in action in the potato chip aisle of any grocery store,

## Week 4: Ideating Design Solutions
Date Started: August 25, 2022
Date Completed: September 2, 2022
### Understanding Design Ideation
**Ideate Phase**
- understanding design ideation, 
- conducting competitive audits,
- brainstorming approaches like "how might we" and Crazy Eights, 
- determining if we need additional research.
**design ideation**
- Coming up with solution after defining the solution
- is the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic without judging or evaluating them. 
- The aim is to generate lots of ideas, even ones that may seem ridiculous at first. Sometimes your most outrageous idea will turn into a great and unique solution!
- no bad ideas
- Ideation can be defined as the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic with no attempt to judge or evaluate them
- Generate a lot of ideas so that when constrainst are presented you can strip ideas that do not pass the requirements
- 

Ideation in the real world
- Brainstorm out loud
- Document all ideas
- Focus on quantity
- Do not allow evaluation
- Gather a diverse team
- Question the obvious
- Evaluate the ideas

**There are a few common ways to evaluate your ideas.** 
- First, is the idea feasible? Is it technically possible to build? 
- Next, is the idea desirable? Does it solve the user problem you're focusing on? 
- Lastly, is your idea viable? Is it financially beneficial for the business?

**Understand the business behind a design**
-  branding has a big effect on how users experience a product.
- Two major components of branding are voice and the 
- we need to keep in mind the fundamentals of driving sales when designing.
- Knowing the successes and failures of your competition can help influence your design decisions.
- we need to consider both the business needs and the user's needs when designing.

### Conduct competetive audits
competitive audit 
- is an overview of your competitors' strengths and weaknesses
- tool to explore ideas for designs

Direct competitors 
- have offerings, meaning products, services, or features, that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience. 
- Essentially, you're both trying to solve the same problem. 

Indirect competitors 
- are a little more nuanced. They either have a similar set of offerings, but focus on a different audience than you, or they have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience as you.

Benefits to competetive audits
First, they help inform your design process. How did your competitors approach designing their products? Knowing what others have done can help you make better design decisions for your own product. 

Second, competitive audits help you solve usability problems. Is your competitor's website difficult to use? If so, you know what to avoid for your own website. 

Third, competitive audits can reveal gaps in the market. Are there user needs your competitors do not meet? Your product might be able to address these user needs. 

Fourth, competitive audits provide reliable evidence. Why is it important to gather evidence? Design ideas are most successful when there's a deep understanding of business needs and market gaps.

Conducting a competitive audit is a great way to familiarize yourself with user experience design by getting more information about a new industry, a new client, and recent industry trends.

Save time, money, and energy.

-   Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their designs. 
-   Suggesting ideas to solve early problems that you’re facing with your own designs. 
-   Revealing the ways that current products in the market are not meeting users’ needs. This is a gap for your product to address!
-   Demonstrating the expected life cycle of a product in the same market as yours.
-   Informing all the different iterations your product could take and how those performed for your competitors.

Limitations

	- prevent yourself from creating 
	- the key is to understand what the competition is doing and use that as a starting point to push forward and innovate.a truly innovative product.
- depends on how well you interpret the findings
- not all designs work in all use cases.
- You should do competitive audits on a regular basis, not just once.

Competetive audit steps
1. outline the goals for your competitive audit. 
	- Make sure your goals are specific. It can help to break down your goals into the different product aspects you want to compare.
	- Compare the customer service rating, options, pricing option, search function 
2. Create a preadsheet with a list of your competitors. 
	- You should aim to include 5-10 competitors in your list
3. Call out the specific aspects you want to compare. 
	- This list of aspects should align to your goals for the audit. 
	- rate them based on the following categories:  

-   **First impressions:** Check out the website on both desktop and mobile devices, and make note of your first impressions. Is the website responsive, meaning that it resizes across devices? Does the design complement the product? How do you feel about the website?
    

-   **Interaction:** Explore the user flow and navigation of the website. What features are available for users? Is the website accessible to all users, including those using screen readers? How inclusive is their website to non-English speakers? Will the user get confused as they click through the website pages, or is the navigation clear? focuses on the user’s ability to quickly and efficiently find what they’re searching for on the website.
    

-   **Visual design:** Review competitor branding and their overall consistency. Does the website appear and feel the same throughout all sections and pages? Does the branding match the intended audience? Is the imagery and color palette memorable? clear and consistent visual design is a great way to draw users into a product and company.
    

-   **Content:** Examine the written content included on the website. Does the tone of the content match the company’s branding? Will users be able to find the details they’re interested in? tone of the content is another way to communicate a company’s brand and engage users.

4. Research. 
	- Visit each competitor's website or app and take notes about their aspects. 
	- Remember to include details like what works well, what could be improved, and whether your competitors aspects meet the needs of your specific audience. 
	- It's also helpful to take lots of screenshots and link to them in the spreadsheet.
5.  Analyze your findings. 
	- Try to spot trends and themes. Ask yourself, what are the similarities between you and your competitors? 
	- Is there a certain aspect that your competitors all approach in the same way?
	- What are the similarities and differences between you and your competitors? Is there a feature that your competitors all approach in the same way? Is there a competitor that is doing something completely unique compared to the others? It's a good idea to make note of the findings. You will use this information in your report.
6. summarize your findings in a report.
	- Your report might be a slide presentation or a document. It's helpful to include screenshots and simple charts or graphics
	- What you include in your report and how you present your findings will vary depending on the audit goals you outlined at the beginning of the process. For example, if your audit mainly focuses on comparing competitors’ audiences, you might want to include a few informational graphics with numbers and figures.

You can grade competitors on a scale of:

**Needs work:** The app is not usable, and users aren’t getting what they need from this aspect of the app.

**Okay:** This aspect has some issues, but with some work, it could meet user needs.

**Good:** This aspect works well, but doesn’t always provide users with the necessary information easily.

**Outstanding:** This aspect feels consistent, and it meets or exceeds the user’s needs.

**present a competitive audit**
- It’s also a good idea to outline your research questions, methodology, and  the features or characteristics you compared across competitors. 
- Summarizing the purpose of your presentation makes it clear exactly what you're trying to learn about the competition.
![[Pasted image 20220828145854.png]]

- summarize what you learned about your competitors’ products, and how they compare to yours. 
- Be sure to point out where your product excels, as well as areas that need improvement.
- As you organize your presentation, think about the most effective ways to present your insights. Keep the overall design as simple and clean as possible. 
- Avoiding cluttered and confusing imagery makes it easier for your audience to follow along and focus on the important information.

**how to use learnings from your competitive audit to ideate.**

```ad-tip
"Research is like party planning. You have to just think of everything ahead of time."
```

```ad-tip
- Everything leads up to you understanding people and processes and I think with research, thinking about how to be empathetic, how that metacognition of being able to recognize a situation, talk to any type of person. Like we don't necessarily choose who our customers are sometimes, but we need to be able to communicate with them and understand them.

### Brainstorm design ideas by sketching
Brainstorming approaches
- how might we
- crazy 8
How might we?
- ideation exercise 
- is a design thinking activity used to translate problems into opportunities for design.
-  carefully considered a very specific user problem to create a list of questions,
- How - encourages us to explore a bunch of ideas instead of moving forward with only one idea for the solution. The word "how" suggests that we don't have an answer yet. 
- "Might" - emphasizes that our ideas are possible solutions, not the only solution. 
- "We" suggests a collaborative effort. Coming up with ideas requires teamwork.

TOO BROAD
How might we design a seat for a child to ride a bike with an adult? Well, that's a fairly broad question. 

TOO SPECIFIC
How might we design a safe, forward-facing seat that attaches to adult's bicycle, so that a child can choose to ride or sleep while an adult rides on a mountain trail? 

JUST RIGHT
How might we design a safe and comfortable seat for a child to ride a bike with an adult

**ways to create How Might We phrases.**
Darren is a concert goer who needs to keep track of their concert ticket because they need the ticket when they go through security.
- amp up the good. 
Think of how you might use any positives in the problem as a solution.

For example, How might we create a traveling experience for a parent and child to enjoy together? 

_How might we make keeping track of tickets a fun competition among friends?_

- Explore the opposite. 
Think of how you’d solve the opposite of the problem you’ve outlined.

How might we design a bike for a 2-year-old to ride with an adult, instead of our original framing of an adult who wants to ride a bike with a 2-year-old? 

_How might we create a way to lose tickets?_

- Change a status quo. 
Think of ways to completely change the process.

How might we improve public transportation options in Olivia's hometown so that she has options other than biking?

_How might we make a non-paper concert ticket?_
- break the point of view into pieces. 
This is especially helpful for long, complex problems.

How might we make a 2-year-old comfortable on a bike? 
How might we easily travel from point A to point B? 

_How might we keep the customer’s ticket from getting lost? How might we make a lost ticket easier for the security team to handle?_

- Remove the bad
Think of how to remove the negative part of the problem entirely. 

_How might we make a way for concert goers to enter a venue without needing a ticket?_

- Go after the adjective
Take any negative adjectives and try to turn them into positives. 

_How might we make the entry to a concert venue less stressful for ticket holders?_

- Question an assumption
Remove or change any processes that you assume have to be in place.

_How might we remove the security check process at a concert?_

- Create an analogy using the established need or context
Think of ways to compare this user experience to another experience.  

_How might we make going through security like playing a video game?_

- Identidy unexpected resources that can provide assistance
Think of how the problem might be solved by a resource that isn’t mentioned in the problem statement. 

_How might facial recognition software help manage concert entry?_

**Sketching**
- point of sketching is to move as quickly as possible to record lots of ideas.
**Crazy Eights**
- is a great way to get ideas flowing for any design problem you need to solve. 
- With Crazy Eights, you’ll sketch eight different designs, each with a new idea for solving the user’s problem.
- you sketched solutions to that problem with no limitations and no thoughts to practicality.
```ad-info
part of the research process requires you, as the UX designer to figure out who you're designing for and what their needs are.

```ad-important
title: so far
- You learned the basics of UX research
= empathize with users
- explored personas
- wrote a user story, 
- identified happy paths and edge cases,
- discovered the benefits of user journey maps. 
- defined the user problem, by creating problem statements and hypothesis statements.
