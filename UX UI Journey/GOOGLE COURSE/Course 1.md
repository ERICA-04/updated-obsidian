# Course 1

**Empathy** 
-   the ability to understand someone else’s feelings and thoughts in situation

**Interaction designers**
-   focus less on how the product looks and instead strive to make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.
- who focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.

**Visual designers** 
- who focus on how a product or technology looks.

**Motion Designers**
- They think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or a website.

**Graphic designers** 
- usually work on the appearance of a physical product, like an invitation or a poster

**UX designers** 
- focus on how users interact with the product.
- use research to understand audiences and learn about their backgrounds; demographics, like age and location; motivations; pain points; emotions; and life goals.

**UX Researcher**
-   The goal of UX researchers is often to understand how a product can provide a solution to a real problem users are having.   
-   The problem usually covers how to develop a product that provides the best user experience.
- UX researchers conduct the studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product.

**UX writers**
- who think about how to make the language within a product clearer to make the user experience more intuitive.

**Production designers**
- who often act as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers.
- make sure first and final designs match in the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handled off to the engineering team.

**UX engineers** 
- translate the design's intent into a functioning experience, like a website or an app.

**UX program** 
 - managers ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish.


**Universal Design**
- One size fits all

**Inclusive design **
- Solve for one, extend to many
-  Create sites that were more easily consumed
-  With inclusive design, you solve for one type of user, and the benefit of that solution can extend to many other types of users.

**Equity-focused design
- It asks designers to focus on designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products.
- Equity-focused design means thinking through all the aspects of a designed product and making sure the product is both accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities.

**Accessibility**
- Designing products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities

**Equality** 
- means providing the same amount of opportunity and support to all segments of society.

**Equity** 
- means providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes.



**4 process of user-centered design**

2. Specify
3. Design
4. Evaluate

**Product Development Life Cycle**
1.  Brainstorm 
2.  Define
3.  Design
4.  Test
5.  Launch

**Characteristics of a Good Design Experience**
-   Usable
-   Equitable
-   Enjoyable
-   Useful

**UX Design Framework: Design Thinking**
1.  Empathize
2.  Define
3.  Ideate
4.  Prototype  
5.  Test

Design Sprints [DESIGN SPRINT EXAMPLES](< Share and engage with the Design Sprint Community (designsprintkit.withgoogle.com)
Phase 1: Understand
Phase 2: Ideate
Phase 3: Decide
Phase 4: Prototype
Phase 5: Test

**Post-Sprint**
Retrospective 
- is a collaborative critique of the team's design sprint.

The key questions to ask during a retrospective are: 

1. What went well? 

Questions you might ask during this part of the retrospective include:
	• Which tools saved you the most time and effort?
	• When did you feel the most satisfaction?
	• What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?

2. What can be improved?
Questions you might ask during this part of the retrospective include:
	• What went wrong that caught you off guard?
	• Which problems came up the most often?
	• When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?

Then, examine the sprint’s outcome or final product, and ask questions like: 
	• Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design? 
	• Did an external factor derail your productivity? 
	• And most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem?

Your conclusions should inform how you conduct the next sprint. 

Questions you might ask include:
	• What did you discover during the sprint that you’re still wondering about?
	• How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions?




**Foundational research answers the question
	•  "What should we build?" 
	• "What are the user problems?" 
	• "How can we solve them?" 

The **goal of foundational research** is to help define the problem you would like to design a solution for. 


**Phase 3,** of the product development life cycle, is called **design research**. Some teams call it **tactical research**

Design research answers the question
	• "How should we build it?" 
	• How was your experience using the prototype today? 
	• How easy or difficult was it to use? Why? 
	• Did you encounter any challenges? 

The **goal of design research** is to inform how the product should be built.


**Post-launch researc**h can be used to evaluate how well a launch feature is meeting the needs of users. 

Post-launch research answers the question
- "Did we succeed?" 

The **goal of post-launch research** is to understand how users experienced the product and whether it was a good or poor user experience


**BIAS**
**Primacy bias** 
- UX designers may also struggle with primacy bias, where you remember the first participant most strongly

**Recency bias**
- it's easiest to remember the last thing you heard in an interview, conversation, or similar setting, because it's the most recent.
- overcoming primacy and recency
	- Recency and primacy biases also demonstrate why you should interview each participant in the same way.
	- Take detailed notes or recordings
	- 

**Availability bias**

**Social desirability bias**

**Implicit biases**
- is a collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge.
- overcome
	- reflect on our behavior behavior
	- ask others to point on our implicit biases

**False consensus**
- happens when we overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design, which creates a false consensus.
- overcoming
	- identidy and articulate your own assumptions.
	- survey large groups of people

**Confirmation bias**
- Occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have
- Overcome
	- ask open-ended questions
	- actively listen
	- include a large sample of users
	- 

**Sunk cost fallacy**
- This is the idea that the deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course without feeling like we've failed or wasted time.
- overcome
	- To avoid the sunk cost fallacy, break down your project into smaller phases
	- and then outline designated points where you can decide whether to continue or stop.

title: Passion about designing
PASSION

I wanted to harness this power to positively affect the lives of people around me, especially those who tend to be marginalized or forgotten. As an intern in UX design, I worked on products for people with chronic pain. I realized how important and impactful it is to consider the needs of people with disabilities, and how much I wanted to create products to help them. So I continued researching and empathizing with those who are disabled to understand how I could uplift them with my work. It's a passion I'm looking forward to sharing with you during this program.

title: Goal as a designer
GOAL

Our goal as designers is to build experiences that are accessible to users with the widest range of abilities. In other words, no one should be excluded from using a product that we built because we didn't consider their needs when building it. In inclusive design, there's no such thing as normal. There's no average person or target audience that we should design for.
