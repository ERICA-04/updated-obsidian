**Design a pet registration flow for dog and cat boarding**

#### Intro to Adobe XD
responsive web design 
-  allows a website to change automatically depending on the size of the device
#### Empathize with users
- Empathy help you spot user problems and solve these problems is the ultimate goal of UX design

**Types of Pain Points**
Financial - money-relates
Product - quality issues
Process - user experience issues
Support - getting help from customer service

#### Define user needs
**user story**
- is a fictional, one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions. 

Advantages:
- User stories deepen our ability to connect to our user's needs.
- prioritize our design goals
- Unite the team
- Inspire empathetic design decisions
- Personalize pitches to stake holders


**User Journey Map** 
- is a series of experiences a user has as they interact with your product while they want to achieve a specific goal. 
- User journeys build off the personas and stories you've already created. 
- They help you think and feel like the user,

Benefits
- user journey maps can help create obstacle-free paths for users that solve their pain points as clearly as possible. 
- user journey maps can reduce the impact of designer bias,
- highlight new pain points that a user might experience along their journey as they use your product. 
- user journey maps can help you identify improvement opportunities 


#### Define the problem
problem statement 
- is a clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed.

best practices
- Human-centered language
- Broad enough for creative freedom
- Narrow enough to be solved by a design solution

##### Determine research goals and questions

As you start to think about conducting UX research, you might be wondering: How do I know I'm asking the right questions? This reading will help you with just that!

**Note:** You're not being asked to conduct interviews in this course. You'll be provided with some fictional user bios that you will use to inform your research. However, it's important to start getting practice formulating effective interview questions. This will help you complete the activities later in this course, and will serve as practice before you conduct actual interviews in later courses.

##### **Determine research goals**

You want to ensure that the interviews you conduct are worthwhile, both for you and for the participants. To make the most of your time together, you need to determine clear goals for the interview. As a UX designer, what do you want to learn from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with?

Here are some examples of common research goals when it comes to empathizing with users:

-   I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
    
-   I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
    
-   I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing.
    

#### **Write interview questions**

Keeping the goals of the interview in mind, you can write your interview questions. The more aligned the interview questions are with your goals, the more useful the data you obtain will be.

There are a few best practices to keep in mind when writing interview questions:

-   **Ask open-ended questions.** Open-ended questions allow the person being interviewed to answer freely, instead of with a simple “yes” or “no.” For example, if you’re designing an app to help people find dog walkers, you should ask “Could you describe your experience with finding and scheduling dog walkers?” instead of “Have you ever used an app to find a dog walker?” Keep in mind that the questions you ask during interviews should not lead or pressure participants towards a desired response; instead, asking open-ended questions lets participants share their true thoughts and perspectives.
    
-   **Keep questions short and simple.** It should be easy for interview participants to understand what you’re asking.
    
-   **Ask follow-up questions.** During the empathize phase of the design process, interviews should be conversational, so encouraging participants to elaborate is a best practice. After a participant answers an interview question, try asking them “Why?” or use the phrase, “Tell me more about that” to keep the conversation flowing.

Research is an essential part of the UX design process and empathizing with users. Taking time to outline the goals for your research will help ensure the feedback you obtain is valuable.

In the next activity, you'll create research goals, determine your target audience, and practice writing interview questions to start laying the foundation for your portfolio project.
## WEEK 2: Ideate solutions to the user's problem
##### Conduct a competitive audit
Ideate phase
- is a process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic, with no attempt to judge or evaluate them

competitive audit 
- is an overview of your competitors' strengths and weaknesses.
Benefits
- Identify your key competitors 
- Review the products that your competitors offer
- Understand how your competitors podition themselves in the market
- Examine what your competition does well and what they could do better
- Consider how your competitors talk about themselves

Steps
1. Outline the goals
2. Create a spreadsheet with a list of your competitors
3.  Call out the specific features you want to compare
4. Research each company
5. Analyze findings
6. Summarize finding
7. Summarize findings and reports




#### Generate ideas for designs

DESIGN THINKING ACTIVITIES
- how might we
    - how - explore bunch of ideas
    - might - ideas are possible solution not the only solution
    - we - collaborative effort
    - 

#### Plan information architecture

information architecture
- or IA, organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product and where the information they want is. 
- Effective information architecture is key to creating a seamless user journey.

**Importance**
- organize and define the structure for your website
- Provide a high-level view of a product
- Help stakeholders review your design
- Help engineers understand how to organize the data
- Allow your design to grow and iterate with the design 

#readings 
[The Beginner’s Guide to Information Architecture in UX](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/information-architecture/introductory-guide-to-information-architecture/) or this article from UX Planet about [the basics of IA for designers](https://uxplanet.org/information-architecture-basics-for-designers-b5d43df62e20).

**four common site structures:** 
- **hierarchical**
    - s one of the most popular website structures. It's a top-down approach to structure that starts with top level categories of information referred to as the parent level. 
    - Then content is narrowed into more detailed information called the child level. 
    - The structure is very similar to a family tree, which is what the parent and child level terms are based on.
- **sequential**
    - A sequential model is a website structure that leads users through a step-by-step process. 
    - Sequential websites order their pages from a starting page to an end point, sort of in a line.
- **matrix**
    - matrix model is a structure that allows users to follow their own path, since content is linked in several different ways.
    - web modal
- **database.**
    - is a website structure that mixes a database, or an organized collection of information, with search functionality. 
    - A database model creates a dynamic experience for users that includes advanced filtering and search capabilities.

**sitemap** 
- is a diagram of a website or an app that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled.

#accessibility 
A clear organizational structure is also important for accessibility. Users of all abilities, identities, and experiences need to be able to successfully move through a website's design. Sitemaps create an organized flow that takes your users from one task to the next. This is especially important for any users interacting with your site using assistive technology. Organizing your site using a clear structure allows all site visitors, including those using assistive technologies, to navigate your site more efficiently.
## Week 3: Create wireframes
#### Create Paper Wireframes
- **Single column layouts**
    - only one column for content 
- **Multi-column layouts**
    - two or more columns for content

**focal point** 
- is a specific and distinct area of the website that captures users' attention.

**"above the fold"** 
- refers to the content on a webpage that doesn't require scrolling to experience.
**box layout** 
- is a layout that consists of boxes or squares of various sizes and proportions. 
- Box layouts are often found at the main starting point or homepage of a website.
**featured image layout** 
- places the user's focus on a single image or video that often takes up the entirety of the page.
**Asymmetrical layouts** 
- have purposeful imbalance between different sides of a page. 
- You may use an asymmetrical layout to place emphasis on certain parts of the page, such as images or headlines.
- F-shape 
    - layouts mean that the pattern users will likely browse content on the page follows the shape of an F. 
    - An F-shape layout is commonly used present a lot of material on a single page.
    - This layout is often used on search result pages like this one. 
    - The user follows the shape of the F as they explore the page. 
- Z-shape 
    - is where users skim information starting left to right, then move diagonally to the left, before scanning to the right again, like the letter Z. 
    - It also imitates the natural scanning pattern of Western users, who read left to right and top to bottom. 
    - Z-shape layouts are typically used for sites with less content
**grid of cards layout** 
- features a series of cards that provide previews of more detailed content. 
- Each card can vary in size, but the cards are often a uniform size. 
- Also keep in mind that the size of the cards you use may vary depending on the size of the screen you're designing for.

tiered layer cake 
- is just what it sounds like: It looks like a layered cake, with individual rows or layers stacked on top of one another. 
- Within each row there can be different numbers of columns, and they don't have to be consistent. 
- The tiered layer cake layout is often used in responsive website design, as layers can easily be swapped out or moved around.

**eye-tracking pattern** 
- describes the way in which users with typical vision follow content down the page of a website.

**wireframe** 
- is an outline or a sketch of a product or screen. As the name might suggest, wireframes are relatively bare bones, consisting primarily of shapes, lines, and minimal text.
**layout** 
- is a structure that supports how visual components on a page are arranged. 
- Layouts also demonstrate where each feature of a product fits in with the others, and how users will progress from one screen to the next


#### Plan Responsive Web Pages
Importance
- increases usability
- creates a good user experience for people visiting the website. 
- drives mobile traffic to your website.
- saves money an time

**Breakpoints** 
- are the visual limits that determine when a responsive layout should change to fit all the elements and components properly

#### Create Digital Wireframes in Adobe XD
To determine if you're ready to transition your paper wireframes to digital, ask yourself a few questions. 
- One, do you have an idea of the layout you're aiming for? 
- Two, have you received feedback from peers or managers on your paper wireframes? 
- three, are you ready to consider basic visual cues like size, text, and typography, or other visual elements like content or images

**visual designer** 
- is someone who is a strong brand advocate. Someone who creates clear user interfaces that allow people to accurately predict how a product is gonna work through visual consistency and patterns. It's an exciting time to be a designer right now.



#### Refine Wireframes
#accessibility 
**Headings** 
- support visual hierarchy, as well as support efficient navigation for users of screen readers.
- Screen readers can navigate a webpage through headings, which allows users to listen to a list of all headings, or jump to a desired heading, to begin reading at that point on the website. 
- Users can use the screen reader headings menu to move around to key sections of the webpage.

**Landmark**
- are features used to map out regions of an interface. 
- Headings, which we just discussed, serve a similar purpose to landmarks. 
- Landmarks are used by assistive technology, like screen readers, to provide cues for navigation, allowing users to efficiently move from one section to another.
**Initial Focus**
- is how you attract a user's attention to help them accomplish a task. If your webpage requires the user to do several things, it's best to direct focus to the top of the page, or to the first H1 heading.
- search in google.com


```ad-important
A good user experience design has the power to help users of all abilities, identities, and experiences move easily through a product
```


**Gestalt Principle**
**similarity** 
- means that elements that look similar are perceived to have the same function.
**proximity**
- is the perception that elements that are close together appear to be more related than those that are spaced apart
**common region** 
- states that elements located within the same area are perceived to be grouped together.

## Week 4: Create and test a low-fidelity prototype
#### Create a low-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD

Low-fidelity 
- prototypes are simple, interactive structures that provide a basic idea of how products will look and behave. They're used to communicate big picture design concepts and usually don't include finalized design elements or realistic content. 

High-fidelity prototypes
- are polished designs that exhibit functionality and closely match the look and feel of the final product.

#### Plan and conduct a usability study for a low-fidelity prototype
UX research plan is made up of seven elements: 
-   [Project background, research goals, research questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/9OB79/start-building-a-research-plan-project-background-research-goals-and-research). The project background summarizes the situation that led to the need for this research. The research goals lay out what you’re trying to solve with this design or what you’d like the outcomes of the research to be. The research questions are the questions you need the study to answer.
    
-   [Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/VjZEd/continue-building-a-research-plan-kpis). KPIs are the critical measures of progress toward an end goal. If you want to learn more about KPIs, you can check out this reading about how to [use key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/supplement/yLaQl/learn-more-about-kpis) as well.
    - determining KPIs for your research study, consider the question, "What would indicate that we're making progress toward our ultimate goal?"
    
-   [Methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/GImoc/continue-building-a-research-plan-methodology). The methodology lists the steps you plan to take when conducting the usability study.
    
-   [Participants](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/9b5pa/continue-building-a-research-plan-participants). The participants section describes how and where you'll recruit participants for the usability study. If you want to learn more about participants, check out this reading about [recruiting a diverse participant pool](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/supplement/zR75q/recruit-a-diverse-participant-pool) too.
    
-   [Script](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/lecture/cmlaI/finish-building-a-research-plan-script). Your script helps you organize, prepare, and properly phrase interview questions.


There are six types of KPIs that are typically used in UX research:

-   **Time on task**: How long it takes a user to complete a task. **NOTE**: Time on task may change depending on whether the user uses assistive technologies or has other accessibility needs 
    
-   **Use of navigation vs. search**: The number of users who navigate casually compared to the number of users who navigate using the search function
    
-   **User error rates**: The frequency of mistakes made by users 
    
-   **Drop-off rates**: The number of users who give up without accomplishing a goal
    
-   **Conversion rates**: The number of users who reach their goal successfully
    
-   **System Usability Scale,** or **SUS**: A series of 10 questions evaluating how easy your product is to use


- usability study 
is a research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a product.


implicit bias
- or unconscious bias, is the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we assign to people without our conscious knowledge

Serial position effect 
- is a psychological bias that states that when given a list of items, people are more likely to remember the first few and the last few, while the items in the middle tend to blur.

Friendliness bias. 
- Friendliness bias describes the tendency of people to agree with those they like in order to maintain a nonconfrontational conversation.

social desirability bias 
- describes the tendency for people to answer questions in a way that will be viewed favorably by others.


how can we reduce bias? 
- identify and admit your own biases.
- Find participants from a representative sample. The small group of participants you conduct your usability study with should represent your key user group, as well as user groups that are often marginalized.
- define the research criteria beforehand.
- Stick to open-ended, non-leading questions 
- How did it go? 
- What was your experience like? Or what worked and what didn't work for you, and why? 
- Be mindful of body languages


Analyzing and synthesizing the results from your research is all about turning observations into actionable insights. 

insight 
- is an observation that helps you understand the user or their needs from a new perspective.

**STEPS FROM OBSERVATION TO INSIGHTS**
- Gather the data in one place
- Organize the data 
- Find themes
    - What common patterns stand out in the data you collected?
    - And what did they tell you about your product design?
- Come up with insight
![[Pasted image 20230406220717.png]]
#### Iterate on designs based on research findings

## Week 5: Create and test a high-fidelity prototype
#### Review best practice for creating mockups
mockup 
- is a static high-fidelity design that's used as a representation of a final product. 
- It includes more visual and UI elements so UX designers and their collaborators can get a better idea about the final state of the website or application. 
- Mockups are not clickable or highly interactive, which means they can be used to make multiple iterations without affecting the functionality.



#### Review how to work with design systems

![[Pasted image 20230407191044.png]]

#### Create mockups for a desktop website
**Rasterized images** 
- are made of pixels, which are the smallest single element in a digital display. Each square-shaped pixel is organized and assigned a color, and all of the pixels fit together to form a complete image.****
    - JPEG: The JPEG (or JPG) file format supports millions of pixel colors, making it ideal for photographs. These files are usually rectangular and do not support transparency, meaning any negative space is filled with a white or black background. JPEGs are great to use on websites, because they load quickly and have relatively small file sizes.

    - PNG: The PNG file format also supports millions of pixel colors. They have transparency capabilities, so they are great for images with transparent backgrounds. Because of this capability, however, PNG images usually have larger file sizes and load more slowly than JPEGs.

    - GIF: The GIF file format supports both transparency and animations. Unlike JPEGs and PNGs, GIFs are limited to 256 pixel colors, so they can be more pixelated than other file formats. However, you'll want to use GIFs to create animations in your designs.

**Vector images** 
- are not composed of pixels, meaning they are resolution-independent. Every piece of the image is calculated mathematically from one point to another, in order to form lines and shapes that ultimately create an image.
#### Create mockups for a mobile website
**hamburger menus** are a type of navigation menu that is represented by an icon with three lines.

**flyout menu** provides an overview of a website’s hierarchy and helps users find information to navigate the site.
### Create a high-fidelity prototype
![[Pasted image 20230407213315.png]]
#accessibility 
**Navigation order annotations**
- **annotations** are markers placed next to interactive UI elements, like call-to-action buttons, that demonstrate how people using assistive technology will navigate the app or website.
- Typically, the navigation order of an app or website starts from the upper-left of the screen to the lower-right. This is also called traversal order.
![[Pasted image 20230407213834.png]]
**Hierarchical headings**
- **Headings** are named sections of a page that use different font sizes, which are larger than the body font size. You can use headings to show hierarchy in your designs and help users easily navigate the page.
- ike H1, H2, and H3, allows screen readers to interpret the hierarchy of a page for users.![[Pasted image 20230407213838.png]]


Accessibility labels
- **Labels**, or screen reader verbalizations, add descriptive language to the interactive UI elements on the web page. With a label, there can be no doubt about the purpose of the button, menu, or checkbox.
![[Pasted image 20230407213948.png]]


 **Accessible color and contrast**
 - **luminosity contrast ratio**? It’s a measurement of the contrast between the background of a design and the text color used with it. In short, your designs will be more accessible if you choose a light background with a dark text, or a dark background with a light text.

 
 **Make responsive websites accessible**
 - As you design a responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes, you need to make sure that all versions of your website are accessible.


#### Test high-fidelity prototypes
![[Pasted image 20230407215258.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230407215659.png]]
## Week 6: Document design work and search for jobs
#### Hand off designs
Determine if your designs are final
- Are the designs a true representation of the intended user experience? 
- Have placeholder text, icons, and imagery been replaced with finalized assets? 
- Are participants or users able to interact with and interpret the designs without external guidance?



#### Add a project to your portfolio
#### Search for UX jobs
**generalist** 
- designers with a broad number of responsibilities, 
**specialists** 
- who dive deep into one particular facet of UX design, like interaction, visual, or motion design.


-   **Interaction designers**, who focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
    
-   **Visual designers**, who focus on how the product or technology looks, using iconography, typography, color, space, and layouts.
    
-   **Motion designers**, who think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or website.
    
-   **User interface (UI) designers**, who are concerned with the look and function of a digital product’s interface, similar to visual designers.
    
-   **Product designers**, who work with both visual and interaction designers and are responsible for figuring out how the whole product comes together.
    
-   **UX designers,** who need generalist skills and support a broad number of responsibilities.
