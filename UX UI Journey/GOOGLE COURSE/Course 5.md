# CREATE HIGH-FIDELITY DESIGN AND PROTOTYPES IN FIGMA

## WEEK 1: Starting to create mockups
#### Intro to Course 5
###### Saturday, February 18th 2023
**mockup** 
- a static, high-fidelity design that is used as a representation of a final product called a mockup
- a high fidelity design that represents your final product.
- give UX designers an indication of what the product will look like visually
- 
**visual design**
- which is how a product or technology appears to users.
- The way you arrange elements on a screen can make your design aesthetically pleasing, help users interact with your product, and make your designs more accessible.


#### Begin to create a mockup
Visual elements and layouts
- **typography**
- **iconography**
- **color**

elements are arranged into layout
- grids
- containment
- space

Fidelity
- how closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product

**low fidelity**
- that means it has a lower amount of complexity and is less refined or polished. 
- lo-fi for short. 
- UX designers use low-fidelity designs when we want to get ideas out quickly and leave room for exploration.

**high fidelity**
- that means it closely matches the look and feel of the final product and is more refined or polished overall.
- hi-fi for short. 
- UX designers use high-fidelity designs when we want to test a design that looks like a real product and get more specific feedback from users.


#### Use typography in mockups
**3 foundational elements of visual design**
- **typography**
    - can help add hierarchy to your designs, make text easy to read, and add visual style.
    - Typography adds to this visual style and displays a company's identity.
- **iconography**
- **color**
    - Think about the messages that certain colors communicate, how people understand color, and how colors mix, match, or contrast with one another.

**other foundation elements**
- size
- shape
- direction

title: how to become a better designer
But appearance isn't everything; it's a UX designer's job to ensure that any decisions about a product's visual design, still consider usability the top priority.
```

Three steps to find the perfect typography for your design:
- Selecting a type classification, 
    - is a general system to describe styles of type.
    - serif and sans serif
- picking a typeface, 
    - overall style of a letter
    - serif typefaces
        - Times New Roman
        - Georgia
        - Cambria
    - Sans Serif typefaces
        - Arial
        - Helvetica
        - Verdana
- choosing a font.
    - size, thickness and emphasis of letters

- San Serif for apps and websites because it is more legible on screen

**typographic hierarchy** 
- is a method of ordering typefaces and fonts in a layout  to create divisions that show users where to focus and how to find information.

Typography
- adds hierarchy
- makes text easy to read
- matches brand guidelines 

Brand guidelines
- are visual style choices used to communicate a brand's identity, values, and mission.
- Brand guidelines have rules on typography and other visual design elements that have already been researched, tested, and approved by the company's design team.
