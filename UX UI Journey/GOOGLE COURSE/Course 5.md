# CREATE HIGH-FIDELITY DESIGN AND PROTOTYPES IN FIGMA

## WEEK 1: Starting to create mockups
#### Intro to Course 5
###### Saturday, February 18th 2023
**mockup** 
- a static, high-fidelity design that is used as a representation of a final product called a mockup
- a high fidelity design that represents your final product.
- give UX designers an indication of what the product will look like visually
- 
**visual design**
- which is how a product or technology appears to users.
- The way you arrange elements on a screen can make your design aesthetically pleasing, help users interact with your product, and make your designs more accessible.


#### Begin to create a mockup
Visual elements and layouts
- **typography**
- **iconography**
- **color**

elements are arranged into layout
- grids
- containment
- space

Fidelity
- how closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product

**low fidelity**
- that means it has a lower amount of complexity and is less refined or polished. 
- lo-fi for short. 
- UX designers use low-fidelity designs when we want to get ideas out quickly and leave room for exploration.

**high fidelity**
- that means it closely matches the look and feel of the final product and is more refined or polished overall.
- hi-fi for short. 
- UX designers use high-fidelity designs when we want to test a design that looks like a real product and get more specific feedback from users.


#### Use typography in mockups
**3 foundational elements of visual design**
- **typography**
    - can help add hierarchy to your designs, make text easy to read, and add visual style.
    - Typography adds to this visual style and displays a company's identity.
- **iconography**
- **color**
    - Think about the messages that certain colors communicate, how people understand color, and how colors mix, match, or contrast with one another.

**other foundation elements**
- size
- shape
- direction 
```ad-important
title: how to become a better designer
But appearance isn't everything; it's a UX designer's job to ensure that any decisions about a product's visual design, still consider usability the top priority.
```

Three steps to find the perfect typography for your design:
- Selecting a type classification, 
    - is a general system to describe styles of type.
    - serif and sans serif
- picking a typeface, 
    - overall style of a letter
    - serif typefaces
        - Times New Roman
        - Georgia
        - Cambria
    - Sans Serif typefaces
        - Arial
        - Helvetica
        - Verdana
- choosing a font.
    - size, thickness and emphasis of letters

- San Serif for apps and websites because it is more legible on screen 
![[Pasted image 20230219220237.png]]

**typographic hierarchy** 
- is a method of ordering typefaces and fonts in a layout  to create divisions that show users where to focus and how to find information.

Typography
- adds hierarchy
- makes text easy to read
- matches brand guidelines 

Brand guidelines
- are visual style choices used to communicate a brand's identity, values, and mission.
- Brand guidelines have rules on typography and other visual design elements that have already been researched, tested, and approved by the company's design team.

#### Use color in mockups
**Importance of color in UX design**
- Add emphasis
    - change in color can draw the attention of users to a focal point in your design. That focal point is often an important action you want users to take, like a sign-up link or a purchase button.
- Communicate Branding
    - which is the visual appearance and voice of a company. Colors play an important role in a company's brand guidelines, just like typography. Color helps define a product's visual identity, making it stand out among competitors.
- Impact the accessibility of designs
- 
 
**60 - 30 - 10 rule**
- One neutral color makes up 60 percent of the color palette in your design. 
- A second complementary color makes up 30 percent of the palette. 
- A third accent color makes up 10 percent of the palette to add emphasis.

```ad-info
Test your color choices on various devices and in different environments. Colors can look different on your desktop computer than they do on your mobile phone. Colors can also look different depending on whether you're using the device in daylight or in the dark.
```

```ad-info
title: Figma
#figma
### Gradient
Linear: Full color on one side of the shape that fades out

Radial: Full color at the center of the shape that fades out in a circle

Angular: Full color in one area of the shape that fades clockwise

Diamond: Full color both horizontally and vertically in the shape of a plus sign that fades away towards the edges in the shape of a diamond

Image: Places an image inside of the element that you’ve created. It’s not really a gradient, but this is where the image option lives on Figma.
```

Color is one of the ways that you, as a designer, can connect with the emotions of users and draw attention to certain parts of a design.

[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG), which are a series of guidelines for improving web accessibility.

##### **Color blindness** 
- results in difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. There are three common categories of color blindness: red-green, blue-yellow, and total color blindness.

There are a few ways to keep color accessibility in mind as you design:
**1. Use icons in designs**, in addition to color.
![[Pasted image 20230319132851.png]]
**2. Use patterns and texture to create contrast.** Contrast is the difference between two or more elements in a design.
To create contrast without relying on color alone, you can add subtle stripes to one column and dots to another, as shown in the image below. With contrasting patterns, in addition to color, the bars in the graph will be clearly differentiated for all users.
![[Pasted image 20230319132937.png]]
**3. Avoid color combinations that could be hard to distinguish** from one another. Here are some color combinations that are often difficult for users who are color blind to differentiate between: 

-   Green & red
-   Green & brown
-   Blue & purple
-   Green & blue
-   Light green & yellow
-   Blue & gray
-   Green & gray
-   Green & black
![[Pasted image 20230319133009.png]]

##### Low contrast sensitivity
People who have **low contrast sensitivity** experience objects as dim or unclear, which makes those objects more difficult for a person to identify. Many people experience low contrast sensitivity on a daily basis.

Solution:
**luminosity contrast ratio,** which is a measurement of the contrast between the background and the text color used on top of that background. As a standard, the WCAG recommends that the luminosity contrast ratio of images and text meets a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1

![[Pasted image 20230319133355.png]]

**Low contrast has a ratio of 2 : 1**. As you can tell, the background color and text are difficult to read.

**Minimum contrast has a ratio of 4.5 : 1.** These background and text combinations are easier to read, even though they use light colors.

**High contrast has a ratio of 16 :1.** These designs are easy to read and use bolder colors for text that stand out on the backgrounds.  

**Maximum contrast has a ratio of 21 : 1.** For the most contrast in your designs, like these, use black and white only

##### Light sensitivity
Some users are just as sensitive to bright light and bright colors as they are to low contrast. **Light sensitivity** is the inability to tolerate light.

![[Pasted image 20230319133620.png]]

#### Use iconography in mockups
**Iconography** is a system of graphic images or symbols that are associated with a subject or an idea. We call these images and symbols icons.

**Icons** are images or symbols that stand for specific actions or tools in an app or website. Using icons in your designs can quickly communicate concepts, instead of explaining a concept's meaning with words.

##### Consider users
- **Make icons universal.**
- **Consider including a text label.**
- **Keep branding clear**

Think about ways that icons can help your design:
-   Save space
-   Catch the user's attention
-   Make it easier to transition to another page or location

##### more visual design elements
Lines: A line is a straight figure connecting two points in space. In the world of UX design, lines can be used to differentiate sections of an app, connect two related ideas, or add emphasis to certain parts of the design. For example, you may choose to place a line below header text to draw additional emphasis to titles.

Size: The size of an element is in relation to other elements and factors that affect the design. Size is an especially important consideration when designing an app for a mobile phone screen size, which is pretty small. The size of elements can determine how users experience your design, for better or for worse. For example, a button that's too small can frustrate users or cause them to tap the wrong part of your design. 

Shape: Shape is defined as lines around a self-contained space that includes length and width. Shapes have a place in almost every app design, whether you use rectangles, squares, circles, or another shape. For example, to view more information within an app, there is often a circle with a plus sign (+) inside, which indicates that users can click the shape to expand a menu and learn more. Alternatively, to close out of a window in an app, app designs often use a circle with an X inside.

Image: In UX design, images are used to tell stories, make an impact without words, and add visual emphasis. Images can be static, like pictures and illustrations, or moving, like animations and GIFs. Either way, you should include images that are relevant to the story you want to tell with your design and that are relevant to the users you're designing for. For example, if your app for home repair services is addressing a specific problem that many users face, like a clogged gutter, it might be effective to include an image of a clogged gutter in your designs to drive emotional impact.

```ad-info
title: important note
As you continue to design your own mockups using visual design elements, keep in mind these two things:



**Visual appeal:** Consider how the content of your designs will be experienced by users in the real world. Are your lines connecting or dividing the right design elements? Are any shapes accidentally overlapping? Did your image upload correctly to Figma? You'll want to review your work with a heightened attention to detail, specifically looking for elements of your designs that might not be the most visually appealing.


**Accessibility:** As you design mockups, think about how users with various accessibility needs might react to the elements you include. For example, do headers stand out from the information placed below, by using lines or another visual design element? And, do all of your images have alternative text? Ensuring that your designs are accessible for everyone is critical to making your work a success!
```

Benefits of including images
- images can help communicate a message without using words.
- Images also create an emotional response from users.
- Images can also set a product apart from the competition.

###### **hyperlink** 
- is a link from one page or file to another, usually activated by clicking on a blue, underlined word or image. Hyperlinks allow people to easily navigate digital products, and a standard stylization makes links instantly recognizable when the text is blue and underlined
**1. An uncluttered page is easier to read.** Hyperlinks can keep your designs organized, making it easy for users to navigate your product. However, adding lots of hyperlinks can reduce readability and impact usability. Choose hyperlinks thoughtfully so you don’t overwhelm and distract your users with too much blue text.

**2. Meet user expectations.** If text is underlined and blue, it should always be a link! Don't confuse your users by ignoring common conventions.

**3. Not all links look the same.** As UX design has evolved, so has the way that links are represented in digital products. Sometimes, a company’s brand standards mean their links won’t be blue. Images can also be hyperlinks. For example, many users now expect the logo on a company’s website to link to the homepage. Even without underlined text, users expect the logo to work like a link

**4. Use descriptive links.** Hyperlinked text should give users an accurate idea of where it will take them. Avoid hyperlinking the word "here," and use a descriptive phrase instead, like "French Quarter Reservation Confirmation." Descriptive language allows users to make informed choices

###### Buttons
**1. Make buttons look like buttons.** Buttons should be easily recognizable as buttons through their shape, size, and color. Most buttons are rectangles or circles, so a star- or heart-shaped button could confuse users. Here are four of the most common button styles:

**2. Be consistent.** Use the same type of button consistently throughout your product. For example, if you use a ghost button on your app’s homepage, you should use that same style on every screen. Consistency helps users recognize which elements are buttons.

**3. Include negative space.** Leave negative (or white) space around buttons so that users can easily tap or click them. UX designers often add padding to buttons, which is extra negative space that keeps the screen from becoming too cluttered. Padding also makes it less likely that users will accidentally tap a neighboring button.

###### Inputs
- are text fields where users enter information. It should be clear what information belongs in an input. It should also be big enough to fit the information to be added

1. **Use visual cues.** Most inputs are open-ended, which means users can type anything into the field. But they also require specific information from users, like a phone number or an email address. To help your users enter the right information (and avoid error messages), give them visual cues.

**Group inputs using subcategories.** When adding more than six inputs to a page, it’s best to group them into categories. For example, you could make a "Personal Information" category that includes inputs for the user’s first name, last name, date of birth, gender, and so on.

#### Understand page layouts - grid and containment
Layout
- which are ways to arrange elements on a page.
- Layouts usually refer to the specific placement of text, style, icons, and images. 
- The goal of layouts is to present information in a logical way, making the important elements stand out. 
- Without a thoughtful layout, your designs will be difficult for users to interact with.

**Grids** 
- are a helpful and practical tool to use as you create designs. Grids give consistency and structure to your design, and they help ensure that your designs fit within the screen boundaries

**basic grids**
- These intersecting lines divide pages into small squares that allow you to easily layout elements in a design.

**layout grid** 
- is a series of columns and alleys that allow you to organize elements in a design.
- **Columns** are the colored blocks, and **alleys** are the spaces between the columns.

**Reasons to use grid**
- First, grids create clarity and consistency. An effective grid guides the eye, making it easier and more pleasant to scan elements on the screen. 
- Second, grids quicken the design process, making it faster to place elements on the screen. 
- Third, grids make it easier to collaborate on designs. With a grid, designers will generally know where to place things.

##### Containment
- uses visual barriers to keep designs neat and organized. 
- Barriers like lines or colors help limit content to a specific section of a design.
**4 methods of containment:** 
**- dividers**
    - dividers are lines that separate sections. They can be simple yet effective tools for quickly breaking up content that doesn't belong together.
**- borders**
    - Borders are continuous lines that often form shapes like squares or rectangles.
**- fill**
    - assign colors to borders and shapes
**- shadow**
    - create dimensions in combination with borders to fill

#### Understand page layouts - negative space
Spacing
- proxomity princciple in action
Importance
- Provide emphasis on a focal point within the design
- Group items together, which is also know as **proximity**
- help with readability
- Negative space draws attention to important elements


-   **Line spacing** is the vertical space between two pieces of text. Think of reading a book: the negative space between sentences in a paragraph keeps letters from overlapping and makes content easy to read. The same goes for your designs!
    
-   **Padding** is the negative space surrounding content, or between the border and the design elements. Padding gives objects space to exist before the user moves to look at another element of the design. In the image above, padding in the dog walker app provides symmetry to the design and keeps elements from being crowded together.
    
-   **Margins** are the space outside the border of the design. You can think of margins as a way to keep you coloring between the lines of your design. In the image above, you’ll notice the edges of the design surrounded by the margin.

-   Created and defined fonts for your mockups
    
-   Added and defined color for your mockups
    
-   Created icons for your mockups
    
-   Created and applied dividers or borders to your mockups
    
-   Reviewed and revised negative space within your mockup
- 
#### Week 1 review



## WEEK 2: Applying visual design principles to mockups
#### Apply visual design principles to mockups (part1)
**layouts** 
- refer to the specific placement of text style icons and images.

**Fundamental Concepts**
1.) **Emphasis** 
- means something that attracts attention. 
- Emphasis is all around us and we depend on it to translate information for us in everyday life.
- We use emphasis to intentionally guide a user to what we want them to pay attention to

Ways to emphasize
- size
- texture
- contrast

**Visual weight** 
- is a measure of the force that an element exerts to attract the eye.

Deciding what to emphasize
- where do I want to draw the user's attention? 
- what are the user's goals?

**2.) Hierarchy**
- Hierarchy is a visual design principle that orders elements on a page and highlights them by their importance. 
- The goal of hierarchy is to guide the user. Adjusting size and color is a common way to distinguish hierarchy in visual design. 
- Hierarchy in UX design can help the user understand the relative importance between different elements.
- helps people who use assistive technology

```ad-info
title emphasis vs hierarchy
hierarchy refers to a group of elements that are organized in order of importance. 
On the other hand, emphasis is about making one element stand out from the other elements surrounding it.
```


#### Apply visual design principles to mockup (part2)
**3.) Scale and Proportion**
**Scale**
- Scale is a concept that's used to explain the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design.
why important
- create emphasis
- Show similarity and contrast
- communicates visual hierarchy
**Proportion**
-  is about the balance or harmony between elements that are scaled. 
- In other words, proportion helps UX designers make sure the size relationship between elements makes sense. 
- This means that the elements appear to be in balance with one another.

**4.) **Unity and Variety****
**Unity**
- Unity measures how well elements of your design work together to communicate an idea.
- Unity can be created by using a consistent color scheme, complementary fonts, and consistent spacing.

Variety
- which is about varying the elements in your design to break up monotony. 
- Using diverse elements can add energy and pizzaz to a design.


```ad-tip
A balanced combination of unity and variety can provide visual cues for users while maintaining their attention.

```

#### Refine mockup designs
Gestalt
- Psychological Principle
- describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects. 
- In other words, the human brain will attempt to simplify and organize complex images by subconsciously arranging the parts into a cohesive whole. 
- Basically, your brain is wired to see structure, logic, and patterns. Gestalt principles help us better understand how all the individual design choices we've been making come together and how they might be interpreted by users. 
- Gestalt principles also offer designers a way to step back and review their work from a different perspective.

Gestalt Principle
**1. Similarity**
- states that elements that look similar are perceived to have the same function. 
- In other words, similarity focuses on things that look or behave the same way and how the user will relate those items

**2. Proximity**
- which states that elements that are close together appear to be more related than elements that are spaced farther apart. In other words, humans perceive objects close to each other as connected.

**3. Common Region**
- which states that elements located within the same area are perceived to be grouped together. 
- Although it's connected to the principle of proximity, the principle of common region differs because it has less to do with spacing elements apart and more to do with using visual elements to form sections

**4. Closure**
- describes that when a human looks at an incomplete object, they subconsciously complete the image to see a whole, completed object.

**5. Continuation** 
- Gestalt Principle of **continuity** states that elements that are arranged in a line or on a curve appear to be more related than elements not on the line or curve.

**6. Symmetry**
- describes that elements are more visually pleasing when the parts of an object are balanced or are mirror images of each other.
- **asymmetry**, which is a lack of balance and equality, can emphasize an element's importance and create visual interest. Using asymmetry in your designs can help call attention to a specific item or grouping of items.


Visual balance 
- is the sense that a design is equally weighted on both sides of its emphasized center. 
- Visual balance gives the design a feeling of completeness.

```ad-tip
#ux/ui
Design review checklist
- Detail view
- Page-level view
- Function-level view
- App-level view
```

**Hue** 
- refers to color families (like red, green, or blue), 
**Value** 
- is a color’s lightness or darkness. The lightest value of any color is white and the darkest is black (as in the graphic above).
- is key to creating contrast in your designs.
**Saturation** 
- refers to the intensity and richness of color.
**Orientation** 
- refers to the layout of your design. Orientation often corresponds with the platform or device you are designing for.
**Intrinsic interest** 
- refers to how eye-catching a visual element is to users.
**Perceived physical weight** 
- is the illusion of weight and volume that each visual element conveys. When creating elements that simulate objects with physical weight, you’ll want each element’s dimensions to proportionately relate to the others.

###### Types of navigation
**Navigation bars** 
- display the navigation links to the most important pages of the product in a single bar along one area of the screen. Depending on the design, this bar can be horizontal or vertical.
**Tab bar**
- are very similar to navigation bars, but they display page links as tabs that can be clicked on and off. Tab bars can be icons, they can be text, or they can be both.
**Navigation menu** 
- is a menu that appears when the user clicks the three lines icon on the edge of the screen. These are sometimes called “hidden” menus (because they can be hidden away again) or “hamburger” menus (because of their shape).
**Navigation hub** 
- displays a collection of links on the homepage of the website. With a navigation hub, the user often has to go back to the homepage to change pages. This format helps reduce the amount of content on the screen at one time. T

## Week 3: Exploring design systems
#### Understand design systems
**design system** 
- is a series of reusable elements and guidelines that allow teams to design and develop a product following predetermined standards.
- design systems help teams combine all of these different guidelines in one place, including important information like brand guidelines, components, color palettes, and more.

Visual design system elements
- color
- iconography
- layout
- copy
- animation
- elevation
- typography
- illustration.
![[Pasted image 20230321183639.png]]

**Benefits of design systems**
-  create consistency for designers and users.
- help reinforce a company's brand identity. Design systems keep the visual design elements consistent within a product and across products.
- Scalable
- Save time and money by increasing efficiency for individual and teams
- help designers and developers work together more effectively. 


#### Create a sticker sheet
Sticker sheet
- design kits
- are a collection of elements and components that make up part of the design system.

#### Use design systems
**Elevation**
- is Material Design system for adding layering or depth to your interface. 
- The screen background is usually at zero elevation, while a button might be at four elevation
**States** 
are visual representations that communicate the status of a component or interactive element.

```ad-important
#accessibility
Accessibility is important because it creates an equitable experience for one who would normally not have one.
```

## Week 4: Participating in design critique sessions
#### Give and receive design feedback
Feedback
- asking for or receiving ideas about what is or isn't  working 

Advantages:
- Improve your design
- Build your confidence and skills
- Broaden your perspective as a designer

Tips for giving feedbacks
- Adjust for each situation
- Have a reason to support your feedback 
- Describe problems with the design, not offer solutions
- 

#### Explore design critique sessions

**Design critique session** 
- s a planned period of time where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback. 
- Design critiques are also a great opportunity for you to practice giving feedback to other team members.
- 3 roles
    - Facilitator
        - the crit session and guide the process. They might also monitor the time and make sure that the objectives are being followed
    - Presenter
        -  designer who is sharing their work with others in the session. If you're the presenter, you need to prepare beforehand. Be actively engaged and be ready to ask questions for clarification after feedback is given.
    - the reviewer or critic. 
        - The reviewer gives feedback about the design and offers clear actions to take. There is usually more than one reviewer in a design critique
    -  notetaker. 
        - This person can capture all of the ideas and feedback from the reviewers so that the presenter can stay fully present and focused.

**Best Practices**
- First, take in the feedback, and decide if you want to ask for clarification or respond.
- Focus on active listening
- Be ready to take action after the session


**Questions to focus preparing presentation**
- Who are you designing for? 
- What problem are you trying to solve? 
- How are your designs solving or not solving these problems? 
- Where in the design process are you? 
- What aspects of your designs are you seeking feedback on?




#### Observe a mock crit session
30 minutes
5-10 minutes - presentation
20 mins - Q&A 


How the presenter responds to feedback
- Ask yourself, is the presenter actively listening? 
- Is the presenter taking notes?
- What types of follow-up questions is the presenter asking? 





**How the reviewers give feedback**
- do the reviewers share the reasoning behind their feedback? 

- Do the reviewers focus on problems with the design instead of offering solutions? 

- Do the reviewers connect their feedback to the objectives of the design critique session? 

Meet you there.



#### Implement feedback from crit session
Ask yourself, 
- how can I synthesize the feedback from the design critique session? 
- what feedback do I want to take action on to improve my designs or the user experience?

Synthesize feedback and identify themes like in usability study

**WebAIM,** which stands for Web Accessibility in Mind, allows you to check the contrast between two colors and compare them against 

**WCAG,** or the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines' standards.
## Week 5: Creating high-fidelity prototypes
#### Understand high-fidelity prototypes
prototype 
- is an early model of a product that demonstrates functionality.
Low-fidelity 
- prototypes are interactive versions of designs that use content placeholders. 
high-fidelity 
- prototypes are detailed, interactive versions of designs that closely match the look and feel of the final product. 
- high-fidelity prototype takes the design work you've already done in the mockups and makes it interactive. 
- Remember that mockups focus on visual design, but prototypes focus on functionality. 

A high-fidelity prototype must have these three pieces: 
- visual elements like color, images, icons, and typography; 
- navigation to help users move between screens; 
- interaction, like gestures and motion, which make the prototype function

High-fidelity prototypes
- How does a user get from one screen to the next? 
- How easy is it to locate navigation-related icons, like back arrows? 
- At what point does the user journey end? 
- Finally, a high-fidelity prototype needs interactivity

Steps to create a hi-fi prototype in Figma
- lay out the mockups
- connect the screens
- add interaction details
- adjust the animation, 
- complete for all screens
- share your work. 


#### Explore gestures and motion
**gesture** 
- is any method of interaction a user has with information on their device using touch. 
- The most common gestures are tapping, scrolling, swiping, and zooming.
**Motion** 
- is a way to animate static design elements to focus the user's attention and tell stories.

```ad-info
gestures and motion help enrich the user experience and increase usability.
```





**3 parts of interaction**
trigger 
- defines what type of interaction will cause the prototype to advance forward.
- The trigger could be a mouse-click, touch gesture, or the time elapsed in the current frame.

action 
- defines what happens when the user interacts with the hotspot. 
- This could mean moving to another frame or opening a link. 

destination 
- could be another screen in the prototype or an overlay that appears above the current screen.


##### Accessibility Considerations
#accessibility
- provide alternative options to using gestures like buttons
- think critically about the speed and duration of motion in your designs. 



World Wide Web Consortium, 
- also called W3C
- recommends that animations are under five seconds long in order to be accessible. 
- give users the ability to turn off a motion
- 

```ad-tip
#accessibility 
In Figma, you'll time motion by the millisecond. This means your transitions and other motion should be between **150 and 500 milliseconds.**
```





## Week 6: Testing and iterating on designs
#### Plan a usability study
Refresher
Elements of UX research plan
- the project background, 
- the research goals, 
- the detailed research questions, 
- key performance indicators or KPIs, 
- the methodology, 
- the participants, 
- script for the questions you'll ask study participants.
#### Conduct a usability study

#### Analyze and synthesize study results

#### Iterate on high-fidelity designs
Determine if your designs are final
-  are the designs a true representation of the intended user experience? 
- Have placeholder text, icons, and imagery been replaced with finalized assets? 
- Are participants or users able to interact with and interpret the designs without external guidance?
-   Do the designs follow the existing design system? 
-   Do the designs follow common interaction patterns for their respective platforms?
-   Do users have a clear path when something goes wrong? 
-   Is the design accessible?

# Learn more about creating a case study for your portfolio project

You've finished the final designs for the mobile app you've been working on for the past few courses. Congratulations! What a great feeling. Now, you're ready to showcase your designs to future employers and other designers by creating a case study in your portfolio website. Your case study should include these ten things.

![1. Your role in the project](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9Adz4iJDSYCHc-IiQzmAXg_1f52ca3b9ee44fd2827f269902c08413_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.31.43-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=uGmgquE47jMC_h4QOCxww8GMPG4bXxc9Sy6-glkh34I)

State your role in the project. In the real world, you'll mention the team members who collaborated on a design project with you and list the role that each of you played in bringing the designs to life. But for your project in this course, you covered the design process from beginning to end on your own! You should express that in the case study you're creating.

![2. The goal of the project](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/f4LgNPwhSveC4DT8IUr3OA_2eaffd2ac06e46cd92160aa974048f16_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.31.57-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=daBisDHXIGKRNSljVZpfzZUvRHWnqiU3WGHaKgf9744)

State the purpose of your project based on your findings from the research.

![3. Your target audience](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zMK7oLFiRHyCu6CxYuR8Ig_9c1e0a2215244eca9599f6f0dc359990_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.32.08-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=qwumZN8kq5y_4R6Cv9H0PqANArvmSd-yNIzQAio6mXA)

Describe the users you tried to solve a problem for or help through your design project.

![4. Key challenges or constraints](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mpKUGZPGSsmSlBmTxkrJeQ_7ee7b5116bed4272866c0e9c696656bf_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.32.18-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=TMd3Tml2DB4V_vKusI7ymRyn1q6Ph4rtsAynaGRBPK4)

State the challenges. Some common challenges include things like budget or time constraints.

![5. Research conducted.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/lgn47ntPTtmJ-O57T87ZFQ_e1476fb1e6e3487e980808a37d83e432_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.32.31-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=r84bjUgZ4b87Af4ASUQy7_lk4INLOscLjeJuyPvtHhg)

Mention the details of the research study. What research method did you use, and why did you choose it? What issues did the data reveal that led you into the study? How did the research study look? 

![6. Initial concepts or design strategy](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WvDMHAjbSPmwzBwI29j5uw_b18eaca5571b420798a004099396dee1_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.32.38-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=VAy-xmdvSfqCCasIR2aXu6CwNMTUQHPYlNkm8vCN64U)

Outline your design process and the decisions you made that contributed to that design. This is a good place to back your decisions with data from any research findings or results of a usability study that informed your design thinking.

![7. Your sketches or wireframes](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jbRe2fHnS5y0Xtnx5zucDg_4e0e86c36b874a08be46d61542b69e41_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.32.46-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=U9aETEMqYrNkw3zESFjXXCz6UUe7taOyaV31LsLYoxw)

Show visuals of your design. This includes paper sketches, wireframes, and low-fidelity prototypes of your design.

![8. Results of any user testing](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/JvLoftHbRj2y6H7R2yY9VA_60c514f57519423ea6f86a0ae5a2f932_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.32.55-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=AUQnx1rz7h4Js3euQykMZKqIAEDzf5wwYUwgE1WcLE8)

Discuss the results of user testing. At this point, you want to help others understand why the issues occurred and what the usability tests showed as a result. In other words, what did you learn?

![9. Your final polished designs](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mKgkfndbQ1-oJH53W4NfdA_88c66188323e48d19aacd4588aad4793_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.33.05-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=DSQ4L37pg5NfGHX3qCx41R6pHrXPxIV1IsG4gLUKqng)

Showcase your design. You’ll include a mockup or high-fidelity prototype of your design here to wow your audience.

![10. Conclusion](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/8GEaaSdySaihGmknctmoIA_e30a36349341494ea4153d6249bc03ed_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-3.33.13-PM.png?expiry=1679875200000&hmac=hRyukwN6btA-vsRMXW7g935M266Oz-LzYdA9WBfsfXs)

State your conclusion and possible next steps. This is your chance to talk about what you learned throughout the design process and to touch on the future direction for the product or possible iterations.

## Update your portfolio 

You began creating your portfolio in the first course of this certificate, and hopefully you’ve been revising it along the way, as you created new assets and completed important hands-on activities. One of the biggest things you should keep in mind as you create your case studies is showing potential employers how you learned and adapted through the iteration of your design. Employers value a UX designer's ability to manage the input from stakeholders or users.
