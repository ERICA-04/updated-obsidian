I'm very focused and my mind is just focused on designing the different connection points going from one screen to another and all the different ways that the app could flow. I really like being able to think about,
```

### User research to inform ideation
```ad-attention
Title: Refresher
#refresher/course3
Empathy maps, personas, user stories, user journey
- tools UX designers commonly sed to expand undrstanding of people we're designing for
-  help us create a problem statement, or a clear description of a user's needs that our design should address.

Empathy maps
- tap into our users' minds and hearts to help us understand their thoughts and feelings in a given situation. The insights gathered from empathy maps allow us to come up with ideas for solutions that address the user's problems and appeal to the user on a deeper level

Personas
- help you remember who you're designing for. Ask yourself, are there any specific goals they want to achieve? Or are there any needs that you should design for in order to support the personas?

User Stories
- determine which ones are the most critical to resolve. This can help narrow down which user needs to focus on when coming up with ideas for solutions.

User Journey
- help you come up with ideas for designs that truly support the user's needs and reduce their problems, or what we also like to call "pain points."
```

**how research informs ideation**

our research findings will help you understand how to design your product based on what your users really need.


```ad-tip
title: research gap 

What research should we be doing? 

Where could we have real benefit and impact to the business?
```

```ad-tip
TEST EARLY AND FREQUENTLY

```

### Build Goal Statements
**product goal statement** 
- which is one or two sentences that describe a product and its benefits for the user.
- the goal statement  provides the ideal solution for the design.
- where solutions are listed
- what the product lets users do, 
- who the action affects, 
- why the action positively affects users, 
- how the effectiveness of a product is measured

```ad-tip
Title: Goal Statement Template
#template/uxui/course3
"Our [product (WHAT)] will let users [perform specific actions (WHAT)] which will affect [describe who the action will affect (WHO)] by [describe how the action will positively affect them(WHY)]. We will measure effectiveness by [describe how you will measure the impact (HOW MEASURED)].
![[Pasted image 20220911191521.png]]
```

Example:
Our dog walking app will let users schedule dog walkers quickly and easily, which will affect users who are pet owners by allowing them to choose the most convenient times nd dates to have their pets walked. We will measure effectiveness by analyzing the number of daily and weekly appointments.

Our TradeConference app will let users expand their business which will affect how business owners connect with new clients by giving them the ability to connect with clients at local trade shows. We will measure effectiveness by analyzing show attendance.

The CoffeeHouse app will let users place group orders in advance, which will affect users who have to make and pick up large orders by letting users skip the in-store order line and saving them time. We will measure effectiveness by tracking orders of 5+ items placed through the app.

**transition from the problem the user is facing to the solution we can provide as UX designers.**

### Outline user flows
User flow
- is the path taken by a typical user on an app or website so they can complete a task from start to finish.
-  goal is to map how users achieve a specific goal as they move through a product. 
- That way, we have a clear overview of the product's functionality before the design process begins.

**Circles** - Actions
- indicate the actions users take when moving through a product design.
- circles show steps that must be taken to complete a task from start to finish.

**Rectangles** - Screen
- indicate the screens of a digital product that users will experience while completing tasks.

**Diamonds** - Decision
- symbolize the decisions users make and either move them forward through the flow or back to an earlier part of the flow.
- represent points in the user flow where users must ask a question and make a decision.

**lines** - user flow direction
- provide direction through the user flow based on each user's decision.

### Create storyboards
**Storyboard**
- a tool for ideation that helps you outline an ideal flow for your design.
- is a series of panels or frames that visually describe and explore a user's experience with a product.
- tool to visualize potential solutions to problems the user is facing.
- tool for making a strong visual connection between the insights you uncovered during research and the flow of experience.

**four key elements of a storyboard**
- character - is the user in your story.
- the scene - helps us imagine the user's environment.
- the plot - describes the benefit or solution of the design
- the narrative - describes the user's need or problem and how the design will solve the problem.

**2 Types of storyboards**
1. **big-picture storyboard**
- which focuses on the user experience. 
- focus on what the _user_ needs, their context, and why the product will be useful to the user. Big picture storyboards are often used early in the design process when designers are trying to get stakeholders to support their ideas.
- Big picture storyboards think about how people will use the product throughout their day and why that product will be useful. 
- This helps you understand the entire user experience, including the different challenges, potential pain points, and types of interactions the user will encounter.
- focused on how and why. 
- Think about questions like, How will the user use our dog walking app? Why will the app be useful? And why will the user be delighted by the app? 
- a big picture storyboard can show the emotional engagement that a user will have with our app or with any product.
2. **close-up.** 
- the sketches in each panel focus on the product instead of on the user experiencing that product. 
- concentrate on the _product_ and how it works. They’re best used in the middle to the end of the design process.
- close-up storyboards focus on the what. 
- Think about questions like, What happens on each screen of the product? What does the user do to transition from one screen to another? 
- And after you've created the storyboard, what are potential problems with the flow?
-  focused on the practicalities of the design itself. 

```ad-info
Title: Before creating storyboard
1.  Start with a problem statement. 
    
2.  Create a goal statement. 
    
3.  Set up the storyboard.
    
4.  Add the storyboard scenario.
```

### Get started with wireframes
**Design**
-  solves a real problem that users are experiencing. 
- And a strong design always puts the user front and center.

**Fidelity**
- means how closely a design matches the look-and-feel of the final product.

**Low fidelity**
- that means it has a lower amount of complexity and is less refined or polished. 
- We call low-fidelity designs lo-fi for short. 
- UX designers use low-fidelity designs when we want to get ideas out quickly and leave room for exploration.

**High fidelity**
- that means it closely matches the look-and-feel of the final product and is more refined or polished overall. 
- We call high-fidelity designs hi-fi for short. 
- UX designers use high-fidelity designs when we want to test a design that looks like a real product and get more specific feedback from users.

**wireframe** 
- is a basic outline of a digital experience, like an app or a website.
- establish the basic structure of a page before any visual considerations, like color or images, are added
- wireframes highlight the intended function of the product.
- wireframes help designers save time and resources.
- Wireframes allow the team to quickly try out different design options.


**Elements** 
- are building blocks for creating a design. 
- Most of the time, you'll use these elements to draw wireframes: Lines, shapes like squares and circles, and text.

**Industry standards** 
- are common ways to indicate page elements.
- First is text, which should be represented by horizontal lines. 
- Second is images, photos, illustrations, and icons, which are represented by a circle and an X overlapping each circle. 
- Third, calls to action are often represented by rectangles or circles.

**Benefits of wireframe**
- wireframes inform the elements to include in your design. 
    - Seeing the elements laid out on a page will help everyone decide if the right elements are included. 
- wireframes help you catch problems early.
    - Wireframes allow you to map out how all the elements will look on each page and how users will navigate from page to page.
- wireframes get stakeholders to focus on structure instead of the details like color and text.
-  wireframes allow you to save time and effort.


## WEEK 2: Creating paper and digital wireframes
### Understand information architecture
**Information Architecture (AI)**
- organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product and where the information they want is.

**Importance of Information Architecture**
- organizes and defines the overall structure for the app or the site. 
- it provides a high-level view of a product.
- helps stakeholders review your designs. Stakeholders can evaluate whether the content in this site or app is the correct type of content, and if it's placed in the appropriate places to help achieve business or product goals.
- helps engineers understand how to organize the data, so the eventual development of the product matches the visual designs you've created.
- an information architecture that's flexible allows your ideas to grow and iterate with the design.


A stronger IA generally means clearer wireframes and a better thought out product overall.

```ad-tip
Title: become a better designer
#skills
The ability to adapt your approach at different stages of a project is one of a UX designer's most necessary skills
```

Information architecture is made up of three pieces:

1.  **Organization**: The organization is how different pieces of information connect in a product.
    
2.  **Hierarchy**: The hierarchy is often called the “tree structure” and is where a larger category is placed at the top and specific categories related to the overall category are placed underneath. Peer information is placed side by side (or on the same level as each other).
    
3.  **Sequence**: The sequence enables users to move through an app via certain orders or steps.


**Eight basic principles**
1.  **Object principle**: You should view your content as “living” and as something that changes and grows over time.
    
2.  **Choice principle**: People think they want to have many choices, but they actually need fewer choices that are well-organized.
    
3.  **Disclosure principle**: Information should not be unexpected or unnecessary.
    
4.  **Exemplar principle**: Humans put things into categories and group different concepts together.
    
5.  **Front door principle**: People will usually arrive at a homepage from another website.
    
6.  **Multiple classification principle**: People have different ways of searching for information.
    
7.  **Focused navigation principle**: There must be a strategy and logic behind the way navigation menus are designed.
    
8.  **Growth principle**: The amount of content in a design will grow over time.

#todo/uxui/course3/week2
- [x] sitemap or architecture information - consider the result of empathize phase
- [x] paper wireframes 
    - create multiple wireframes for one page and select which one is the best
    - list important parts needed in a page to remember putting it in every wireframe - or base on sitemap

### Create paper wireframes
Benefits of paper wireframes
-  paper wireframes are the fastest way to get your idea out.
- drawing on paper is inexpensive.
- you can explore lots of ideas.
- narrow our focus


  ### Create digital wireframes
  **Moving form paper to digital wireframes**
  - Is my paper wireframe complete?
  - Have I received feedback on my paper wireframe? 
  - Hopefully by this point you've received feedback from peers or your manager on your wireframes. 
  - Am I ready to consider basic visual cues?

**Lorem ipsum** 
- is meaningless placeholder text written in Latin that you can use to show where content will go, and how a page will be laid out. 
- The use of Latin text to simulate words, without actual meaning, started in the printing industry, where it was used to lay out a printed page before the real text had been written.

**Transitioning to digital wireframes**
- Use actual content for important pieces of text
- hold back on adding expressive content 

Benefits of digital wireframes
- Pay more attention to the details 
- easier to share


### Use Gestalt Principles in wireframes
- **Similarity**
    -  means that elements that look similar are perceived to have the same function.
    - Elements might look similar based on their shape, size, or color.
- **Proximity**
    - states that elements that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart.
- **Common Region**
    - states that elements located within the same area are perceived to be grouped together.

**Gestalt principles** 
- describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects. 
- You can use the principles to organize content on apps and websites so it's visually pleasing and easier to understand.

## WEEK 3: Building low-fidelity prototype
### Create low-fidelity prototypes on paper
Prototype Phase
**Prototype** 
- as an interactive representation of your design solution.
- is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality, without actually building the entire product. 
- A prototype shows stakeholders and your potential users what your design idea can do.
- Users can interact with the prototype and provide feedback before your team invests a significant amount of time and money.

**fidelity** 
- means how closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product. 

**low-fidelity prototype** 
- is a simple interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product would look like. 
- The goal is to make your designs testable so that you can collect and analyze feedback early on. 
- A low-fidelity prototype can be on paper or digital.

**Benefits of paper prototypes**
- inexpensive 
- rapid iteration
- low commitment
- encourage honest feedback
- collaborative activity

**Drawbacks**
- hard to interpret 
- tested in person
- remote collaboration


**Creative ways to make paper prototypes**
- Preprinted templates
    - example on gdrive
- Preprinted templates
- Sticky notes
- Stencils
- Demo device


### Build low-fidelity prototypes digitally
**wireframes** 
- are used to establish an overall structure of the design
**prototypes** 
- the focus is on understanding how users interact with the design. In other words, the user needs to know what happens when they press a button or tap a menu.

### Understand ethical and inclusive design
**implicit biases** 
- are the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge. 
- Whether positive or negative, these biases can unconsciously be mistaken for truth when in reality they aren't. 
- Implicit bias can have detrimental effects on those who are the subject of the bias.

Users can be complex human beings with many unique qualities and distinct needs.



**User research** 
- helps us avoid assumptions about who our users are. 
- Instead, research helps us better understand users and give them what they need.

```ad-important

By creating inclusive user experiences, designers help build a more equitable society.

[Fair is not the default](https://design.google/library/fair-not-default/)[Discrimination by design](https://www.propublica.org/article/discrimination-by-design)


**Deceptive patterns** 
- are UX methods that trick users into doing or buying something they wouldn't otherwise have done or bought. 
- These can include a range of visual, interactive, audio, or motion elements added to e-commerce sites, ads, and other marketing content. 
- Deceptive patterns are ethically wrong and not a good business practice.
- Deceptive patterns were first identified by UX specialists, Harry Brignull in 2010. 


**Common Deceptive patterns**
- **forced continuity**
    - Forced continuity is the practice of charging a user for membership without a warning or a reminder.
- **sneak into basket**
    - Adding extra expenses into a user’s shopping cart
    - When a user has to remove an item from their cart if they don’t want to buy it, which is an extra step that could be easily missed.
- **Hidden cost**s 
    - is similar to sneak into basket, except there are extra charges in your cart instead of extra products.
    - Hidden or unexpected charges in the user’s cart that are not revealed until the end of the checkout process.
- **confirmshaming**
    - which is when users are made to feel guilty when they opt out of something.
    - Confirmshaming makes users feel bad and guilts them into taking an action.
- **urgency**
    - They convince you that you need to purchase an item before you run out of time or miss today's amazing price.
    - the goal of urgency is to rush the user into making a purchase in a limited amount of time, otherwise they'll miss an amazing deal and have to pay full price. 
    - it's about adding increased pressure on the user to commit to a purchase quickly
- **scarcity**
    -  a website makes you very aware of the limited number of items in stock.
    - This injustice scarcity of the product is intended to manipulate you and the numbers are often fake.
  
   


```ad-important
 empathizing with users is about understanding their product needs and solving their problems.

```

dose of dopamine
- which is a natural chemical in the brain that's released when something pleasurable happens. That makes us feel good or intrigued.
- a jingle or a short sound accompanies a notification, or the red flag might wave or use motion to grab your attention. 
- The addition of sound and motion further enhances that dopamine effect.


```ad-important
title: how to become a better designer
As UX designers, we need to be aware of methods for attracting users and ensuring that users have a good experience with our product without deceiving them.
```
**attention economy**.
- battle over users’ attention 
- As a UX designer, the product you create will constantly compete for users’ attention.
- originated with psychologist and Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon, who believed that there are limits on what humans can think about and do at one time.
- any scientists believe that humans aren’t very good multitaskers; technology should help users, not distract them.

**Here are some best practices for you to consider to help you avoid bad design decisions:**

-   **Avoid deceptive patterns.** Be honest with users. Think about your purpose for design and how your own values align with the design. 
    
-   **Think about goals and metrics.** Understand your company’s business goals and key performance indicators. Pay attention to how these business goals might contradict or align with your users’ goals.
    
-   **Share good design practices with the people you work with.** Understand your position of power as a UX designer. You have the ability to influence the decision-making process for good and make sure that the right design choices are being made.****

The idea of attention economy has become increasingly important to the discussion of how design can positively and negatively affect users. The more we respect users’ time, attention, and experiences, the easier it will be to keep the focus of design on people, their needs, and the ways they can enjoy technology.

**Understand your impact as a UX designer**
UX designers have a unique opportunity to improve the way technology impacts the lives of people around the world. 

**Ethical design** 
- is about understanding how your design work affects the world.
**dominant culture** 
- affects the values or norms that are important for other cultures.
- As a UX designer, you should consider the needs of all different types of people, regardless of privilege or power. 
- Society often enables those with the most privilege and power to shape the dominant culture
- Your goal as a designer is to always put user needs front-and-center when creating a product, and that means understanding _all_ of the product’s potential users

**marginalized population** 
- is one where people experience discrimination or exclusion from mainstream society because of specific characteristics or life experiences that are wrongfully deemed as inferior.

Here are a few examples of marginalized populations: 
-   People with disabilities
-   People with limited access to technology 
-   People who speak different languages

It’s important to design products that are inclusive and easily accessible to all users.

**Underrepresented populations** 
- are groups of people whose values and experiences aren’t represented often enough in a society that’s shaped by the dominant culture and their point of view. 
- Underrepresented populations include people of certain genders or sexualities, people of color, and ethnic minorities, among others.

**Edge cases** 
- are situations that a user experiences with a product that the designers didn’t prepare for. 
- The situation or obstacle that arises is beyond the user’s control to fix. 
- As you learned earlier in the certificate program, good UX anticipates edge cases and reroutes users back to the happy path when things don’t go as planned.

**Inclusive design** 
- means making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like ability, race, economic status, language, age, and gender.
- This practice ensures a variety of unique perspectives is present during all phases of the design process.
- The goal of a UX designer is to build experiences that are accessible to users with the widest range of abilities. 
- In inclusive design, there is no such thing as normal, and there is no "average" person to design for.

**Accountability**
- One way to help make sure that your product designs are inclusive for all users is to be held accountable by the people you work with and the users you’re designing for. 
- Seek out the opinions of users, coworkers, and stakeholders who are different from you.
- As you learn more about their perspectives, approaches, and how situations affect them, you can incorporate their insights into your designs.

**Design Ethically**
- Create inclusive personas
- Broaden your definition of “stakeholder”
- Increase collaboration

[PODCAST](https://www.designbetter.co/podcast/benjamin-evans)
[READINGS](https://evalpartners.org/sites/default/files/EWP5_Equity_focused_evaluations.pdf)

As a UX designer, you have a responsibility to approach your work ethically and to keep the user’s best interest in mind. 
The products you design will be a part of the users’ lives, but they should not:

-   Consume or control the user.
    
-   Promote addictive behaviors.
    
-   Promote unhealthy relationships between the user and a device or an app.
    
-   Take advantage of the user.
    

- Instead, the products you design should give users a choice about the actions they _do_ want to take while using your product. 
- Remember, apps should engage users, but apps should also be honest about their intentions and goals.
