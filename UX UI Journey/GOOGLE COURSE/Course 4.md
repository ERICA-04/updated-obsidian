# Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts (TEST PHASE)

## WEEK 1: Planning UX research studies
### Introduction to Course 4
Recap
- **empathize** with users 
- **define** user needs and problem statements
- come up with ideas for design solutions. **(Ideate)**
- You've also created a wireframe and made your way into the **prototype** phase. 
- Now you're going to learn how to conduct research to **test** your prototype. 

**By the end of this course, you'll know**
- how to plan a research study, 
- research with a usability study, 
- analyze and synthesize research results, 
- share and promote research insights, 
- modify designs based on research insights.

### Understand the UX research process
**research study**
- process for conducting 
- a research study is a step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic context to the design process.

**four steps in a UX research study**
step 1: plan the study
- Outline background for the project. 
- set goals for your research
- questions you want to answer. 
- how you will conduct the study
- select participants


step 2: conduct the research
**usability study** 
- is a research method that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design. 
- The goal of usability study is to identify pain points that the user experiences with your designs so the issues can be fixed before the final product launches. 
- During a usability study, you get a chance to see how users interact with your new product or feature. 
- You can also interview users to learn more about their experience.
- Observe how participants interact with your design
- Take notes in a spreadsheet
- Ask participants questions

step 3: analyze and synthesize the results
- This involves trying to find the actual meaning in the data. 
- Look for patterns in the quantitative data 
- explore trends in the qualitative data from participants' answers to interview questions.
- Draw insights and meaning from the data


step 4: share and promote the insights.
**Project stakeholder**s 
- are people who are involved in the project or who will be impacted by its results. 
- Project stakeholders need the results of your research and need to agree with the direction of the project.
- Provide your recommendations
- Raise new insights with the project's stakeholders
- Create a presentation
**Research Presentation**
- Methods
- Data
- Conclusions
- Recommendations

When conducting research, you want to make sure you’re communicating in a way that’s inviting, not commanding.

Being aware of the words you use is an important step in being inclusive.

### Build a UX research plan (part1)
#### **7 elements of a UX research plan**
##### **project background**
- answers the question: What led you to conduct this research?
- This element summarizes the situation leading to the needs for this research. 
- It's a brief explanation you can give to anyone who asks why you're doing this research. 
- Why is the project background an important part of your research plan? 
- Establishing a project background gets the team on the same page at the beginning of the study.
- HOW TO WRITE THE PROJECT BACKGROUND
    - Identify the signlas that indicate research was necessary
    - Describe previous research
    - List insights the research will generate
##### **research goals**
- What design problems are you trying to solve? 
- And how will the results of the research impact our design decisions? 
- Use your answers to create goals for your research project.
- Research goals state the specific ideas that you want to learn from the research or what you would like the outcomes of the research to be. 
- Research goals help you understand what is the bigger picture of doing this research. 
- Essentially, they drive the entire study.
   
   **How do you develop research goals?**
   **foundational research**
   - run research before you start the design process, your research goal should help you understand why or if you should build the product. 
   - The goals of the research are to better understand the user problem you're trying to solve.
   - the goal of foundational research would be to understand if there is a need for a dog walking app.
   
   **design research**
   - run research during the design phase, your goal should help you understand how to build the product.  
   - it will give you the answers you need to move forward through the design process with confidence.
   - the goal of design research would be to learn how you should build the dog walking app and what features it will need in order to solve the user's problem.
    **post-launch research**
     - if you run research on a product after it has been launched, your research goals help you understand if the product worked as expected.
     - the goals reflect whether you have successfully completed what you set out to do. 
     - The post-launch research goal for our dog walking app could be to understand if the app we designed attracts and retains regular users.


##### **detailed research questions**
- What are the questions your research is trying to answer?
- your research questions are the handful of questions you plan to answer during the study.
- research questions should be the questions you want your research to answer and should align with the goals of your research.
- research questions <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">provide focus and structure</mark> for your research study. 
- research questions will be the main topics you cover in your presentation. 
- Research questions should be actionable. You should be able to identify a clear way to answer the question, and you should know when you’ve found the answer you’re looking for. 
- They should be specific and not too broad. You want to answer specific questions and produce meaningful data.
- They should be neutrally phrased and not leading.  Questions should be phrased so that they don’t sound like you’re assuming a particular answer to the question. 
- They express whether your research method should be quantitative or qualitative.

##### **key performance indicators or KPIs**
- key performance indicators are critical measures of progress toward an end goal. 
- how can you measure your progress toward the research goal?
- measure the effectiveness of your product or prototype

**six KPIs**
- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">time on task</mark>**
    - how long it takes for a user to complete a task.
    - It's generally safe to assume that the less time it takes for users to perform a task, the more effective your UX design is.
- **use of navigation versus search**
    - This KPI indicates the number of people who use a website or app's navigation compared to the number of people who use the search functionality.
    - Ideally, you want to make it as easy as possible for people to navigate the site,
    - to measure use of navigation vs. search, count the mouse clicks or taps on navigation-related parts of your design, and compare that to the number of times a query is entered into the search bar.
    - measure the preference of users
- **user error rates**
    - indicate the parts of a design that cause users to make errors. 
    - An example might be that they click on the wrong icon when trying to check out their cart. 
    - The user error rates help point to areas where you need to make improvements to the UX.
- **drop-off rates**
    - which show how many users abandon the experience. 
    - how many users quit before reaching the end of a purchase or some other endpoint you're trying to lead them to. 
    - Maybe they got bored or maybe they got frustrated because they couldn't do what they wanted. 
    - you want to decrease drop-off rates with each design iteration.
- **conversion rates** 
    - is a number you want to see increase. It measures the percentage of users who complete a desired action. 
    - Let's say you want users to take multiple steps and make a purchase. 
    - The conversion rate tells you the percentage of users that actually made a purchase.
    - To measure the conversion rate for your product, count the number of research study participants who complete a listed action
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">**system usability scale or SUS.**</mark>
    - if you want to answer the question "How easy is my app to use?" 
    -  is a questionnaire to measure the usability of your designs.
    - users are asked to agree or disagree with ten statements about the usability of a design. 
- **Net Promoter Score** (NPS)
    - is a measure of how loyal users will be to your product or service. 
    - The NPS measures the likelihood that a user would recommend your product to a friend or colleague. 
    - Participants rate the question, “Would you recommend this product to a friend or colleague?” on a scale of 0 to 10.

-   **Promoters** are participants who give a rating of 9 or 10, which means they would recommend your product to others. 
    
-   **Passives** are participants who give a rating of 7 or 8, which means they are satisfied with your product, but they probably won’t pass it along to friends or colleagues. 
    
-   **Detractors** are participants who rate from 0 to 6, which means they could warn people away from your product or service.

- To calculate the NPS, subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. 
- When your NPS is positive, it’s a sign that users are satisfied with your designs.
- If your NPS is negative, it’s a sign that your user experience might have bugs, be difficult to navigate, or might otherwise cause frustration among users.


### Build a UX research plan (part2)
##### **Methodology**
 - where you document the steps you'll take to conduct your research. 
 - How will you collect data and how will you analyze the data once you get it?
 - Conduct a survey of perspective users
 - To analyze result use a spreadsheet to identify trends
 - list the procedures you'll use while collecting the information you need to answer your research questions. 
 - This should include the time and place of the product tests and interviews, as well as who will conduct them and how.

Why include methodology in research?
- First, the methodology informs your stakeholders of what will happen during the study, how long the study is, and where it will take place. 

- Second, detailing your methodology will give stakeholders more confidence in your study's results, because they can see all of the steps. This makes it more likely they'll act on your suggestions. 

- Finally, the methodology provides the details that other researchers need to repeat the exact same study in the future.

- example: For our dog walking app, we will conduct a usability study on March 12 and March 13. During normal business hours on March 12, and another after hours on March 13. We will interview five participants individually.


1) the type of research method involved 
2) the steps involved in the research method
3) the type of data that will be generated from the research method.



##### **participants**
- Who will you survey? 
- What characteristics do the participants have?
- The types of participants you select should be based on your research goals.
- choose study participants who are representative of all our users, not just a select group.

What to include?
- Characteristics 
    - The types of participants you select should be based on your research goals.
- Screener Survey
    - you'll use to ask potential participants a series of questions to see if they meet your desired characteristics.
- Incentives
- Diverse perspective and abilities 



**Conducting research with a usability study**
- your research plan will include a **usability study** as the research method
- Usability studies are _primary, qualitative_ research methods because they allow UX designers to make direct and indirect observations based on the participants’ behavior and words. 
- You’ll give each participant a few guided tasks and take notes on how successfully the tasks are completed (direct observation), and you’ll also record the study in order to play it back later (indirect observation)to discover new insights from the study.

```ad-important
title: accessibility
**a11y** (pronounced “A eleven Y”) is used to refer to accessibility.
- More importantly, a11y resembles the word “ally,” which reflects the idea that UX designers need to be allies to people with all types of abilities.
```

**assistive technology (AT)** 
- is a product, equipment, or a system that enhances learning, working, and living for people with disabilities.

**Let’s explore some of the most common ATs.**
- **screen reader** 
    - is an AT that interprets and verbalizes text, button names, keyboard strokes, and code that a website or app is composed of. 
    - Screen readers are often used by people with low vision. In addition to screen readers
    - some people with low vision might use a computer or smart device with a high contrast screen or increased magnification.
- **switch** 
    - is an AT that helps people with disabilities use technology - like computers, phones, appliances, and mobility equipment - with minimal movements and gestures. 
    - A switch can come in many forms, like a button or clicker. For a computer, a switch might replace a traditional keyboard and mouse.
- **Closed captioning and speech-to-text** 
    - are both ATs that convert audio into text for people with limited hearing.
- **Reminder alarms** 
    - with simplified text and supporting images can help people with cognitive disabilities remember important information.
- **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices** 
    - are ATs that support people with cognitive disabilities who may experience speech limitations or learning disabilities by using images to communicate instead of words.

##### **script or discussion guide or questions you'll ask participants.**
- script is also known as the discussion guide. 
- Make sure these questions are specific in speaking to the KPIs you're trying to measure.
- it's about getting to the core of what a user is trying to do, how they think and feel, and what their problems are.

**tips for writing interview questions.** 
- use the same set of questions for each interview.
- ask open-ended questions 
    - "How did you feel about...?" and "What bothered you about...?"
- encourage elaboration
    - "tell me more about that"
- ask the same questions from different angles
- don't mention other users
- don't ask leading questions 

**Parts of script**
**Getting Started**
- Welcome participants
- Thank participants for their time
- Get consent to record
- Learn the participant's basic information
- Remind participants they are not being tested
    - goal is to provide honest feedback about the prototype or product they are testing
    - no right and wrong answers
- Let participant ask questions

**Usability tasks**
- Based on research goals
- Specific
- Make participants take action  
- Avoid providing clues on how to complete the task 

Example: 
Our research goal was to determine if the app we designed is easy or difficult to use. Based on this goal, one task we could ask participants to do is book a dog walker on Friday at 2:00 p.m.

**Conclusions**
- Ask clarifying questions
- End the recording
- Thank the participant

### Respect user data and privacy
For ethical reasons, when conducting research we should always act with integrity, and that includes protecting users' privacy.

**Importance of keeping user data private**
- it's the right thing to do
- Privacy laws and ethics
- Risk of hacking
- Protecting your company's brand

**2 types of data you need to protect**
**1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
- specific details that could be used to identify a user. 
    - names
    - home addresses
    - email addresses
    - phone numbers.
**2. Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)** 
- more critical. 
- SPII is data that, if lost, compromised, or stolen could cause your users financial harm or embarrassment, or potentially lead to their being discriminated against. 
    - social security numbers
    - driver's license numbers
    - passport numbers
    - financial account numbers
    - date of birth
    - race
    - disability status
    - gender
    - sexuality
    - criminal history
    - medical information.

**Privacy and security practices**
- Be transparent about data collection
- Only collect user data that's absolutely essential
- Get active consent
- Detail how you'll use participants' info and protect privacy
- Allow users to withdraw 
- Inform users of who will have access to their data
- Explain how you plan to store and delete users' data


**vulnerable populations**
- there are certain groups of people who have limited ability to provide their consent or have special privacy concerns.


**Safety of research data**
**Data recording**
- It's important to document your study and results in a way that's consistent with UX research standards. 
- Consistent documentation makes it easier to compare the results of any future studies and helps protect you and your company in case of an audit. 
- An audit is a review from an outside party to inspect and verify that a research involving people is ethical and follows the study protocol. 

**Data Storage** 
- This is about making sure that your data is held in a way that is safe from hacking and safe and Physical Damage. 

**Data Retention** 
- In this case, retention means how long you and your company hold onto research data. 
- Some companies limit the amount of time records are kept.

**Tools use to maintain privacy**
- **de-identification**
    - De-identification is removing any identifying information from a user's data that you collect during a study.
    - This can help reduce the amount of identifiable information about the participant that's shared with other people.
    - Another option is to allow participants to choose their own fictitious name. 
    - This helps keep the human element instead of numbering participants like participant 1.
- **non-disclosure agreement or an NDA**
    - Non-disclosure agreement is a contract that gives one party legal protection against another party stealing their ideas
    - helps protect your own data and your company's data.
    - An NDA is a contract, and if someone breaks that contract, they might have to compensate you for the loss of your idea and any profit you may have lost out on because the idea was stolen.


## WEEK 2: Conducting research with usability studies

**Usability studies** 
- are a research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a design.
- usability studies give UX designers a way to test their designs and get feedback without much risk and a lot of reward.
### Conduct a usability study
The user's feedback helps the design team make important improvements to the user experience.

**concept testing**
You can conduct a usability study when you have an early idea, like a lo-fi prototype that is only somewhat interactive. 


**how much feedback about my design should I get?** 
- We recommend recruiting a handful of participants for a usability study. For our examples, we'll have **five participants** in the usability study. This sample size is large enough to uncover major user issues but small enough to keep the cost down.

2 types of usability study
moderated usability studies 
- a person guides participants through the study in real time. 
- moderator - person who guides participants through this study
- The moderator's goal is to help participants interact with the product 
- moderated usability studies allow for rapport building between the moderator and participant, which can help the participant open up and share more feedback about the design. 
- Moderated studies work best when you want to dig into the details because you can ask follow-up questions throughout the session to learn more.
unmoderated usability studies 
- participants test out the prototypes without human guidance. 
- Usually, the study is recorded on video and the UX team reviews the video footage after the study and collect their feedback along the way.
![[Pasted image 20221017135045.png]]

**Advantages of moderated**
- Build rapport
- Observe firsthand
- Provide live guidance.
- Explain the user journey.
- Control the conversation.
- Make language adjustments
- Gain clarification.
**Disadvantages of moderated**
- Influence or bias
- Self-identification
- Participant pool
- Difficult scheduling
- Reliable internet required
- High cost

**Advantages of unmoderated**
- Natural product interactions.
- More participants
- Easier scheduling
- Inexpensive
- More privacy.
- Simple user journeys.

**Disadvantages of unmoderated**
- No real-time support
- No live follow-ups
- Potential distractions.
- Possible privacy breaches.
- Inaccessibility.
- More data to analyze.
- More data to analyze.

### Observe a mock usability study
### Explore usability study best practices

- A usability study is at its best when participants come from diverse backgrounds and have varying abilities. 
- The unique life experiences, perspectives, identities, and abilities of participants will inform the feedback they provide about your designs.
-
```ad-info
- Your goal is to create designs that work for all types of users, so learning from a diverse pool of research participants is key.

```




How to begin a moderated usability study?
1. Get Comfortable. Build a rapport with participants.
    - establish a professional but friendly rapport
2. Put People First. Thank participants for coming.
3. Remind participants to be open and honest
    - remind participants that their feedback on the product has the potential to help millions of users.
    - tell them that constructive criticism are welcome 
4. Have participants fill out paperwork like an NDA
    - If the NDA is set up correctly, it helps build trust with participants and increased rapport. This is especially important with participants from historically marginalized communities, or at-risk populations who have often been taken advantage of in research.
5. Explain the focus of the study and what participants will give feedback on 
    - Give the participant a roadmap or a preview of what's to come. 
    - Make it a practice to check in with the participant to make sure they're comfortable with what you've planned. 
    - Establish the ground rules for the study.
    - This is the time to let participants know what you'd like them to do and give them specific examples of how.

```ad-info
If a participant can't complete a task, that isn't a reflection of their personal abilities, it's a reflection of the design's usability.
```

with the participants right from the start.

- To conduct a successful moderated usability study, you need to know what kinds of questions to ask participants and how to ask them.

**Techniques for moderation during the usability study itself.** 
- ask open-ended questions.
- Ask follow up questions
    - tell me more about that
    - expound on that
- Summarize their answer for confirmation


**five best practice**
**GET COMFOTABLE**
- Participants in a usability study provide the best feedback when they feel comfortable with the moderator 
- Starting with **getting-to-know-you small talk** can make it easier for participants to feel comfortable and open up
- thank participants for coming
- It’s also helpful to remind participants that they should be **open and honest** about their experience

**PUT PEOPLE FIRST**
- use participants’ preferred pronouns and identifiers
- ask whether they have any other communication preferences
- When engaging with participants of different backgrounds and abilities, **use people-first language.** Literally! Put “people” or “person” first in your phrasing. For example, you should say “person with a disability” instead of “disabled person.”
DON'T SKIP THE PAPERWORK
- Ask participants to sign a **nondisclosure agreement** (NDA), which informs participants that they can’t talk about your product or the usability study publicly. 
- You should keep this document in your records because it protects confidentiality and your intellectual property.
- Participants also need to sign paperwork to **allow their session to be recorded**.
**COMMUNICATE CLEARLY** 
- **Explain the focus of the study** and what participants will give feedback on. 
- Give the participant a roadmap or preview of what’s to come during the session.
- introduce the **think-aloud method**, which is a type of data gathering that has participants turn their internal thoughts into shared ideas through spoken, signed, or typed words.
- **remind participants that they are not being tested**. The goal is to understand how the user is experiencing your product, so there’s no right or wrong answer!
- If the participant can’t complete a task, that isn’t a reflection of their personal abilities; it’s a reflection of the design’s usability.
**ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION**
- **Use the same set of questions with each participant**
- **Ask open-ended questions**.
- **Encourage elaboration**
- **Ask the same question from different angles.**
- **Don’t mention other participants.**
- **Don’t ask leading questions.**


- we need to uncover the right solution by understanding what the problems are. 
- User experience helps us to understand, from people's perspective, what the problems they are and how they're experiencing it, and how they imagine we could help through the design of technology to improve on the problems that they're facing. 
- User experience can help us validate whether we came up with the right solution.

```ad-info
title: #uxresearcher
- I want to ensure that the experience that we put out there works for them.
- There are times where we miss the mark and it is my job to bring those insights back to the team, unfiltered, so that we can make improvements.
```




### Identify biases when interviewing participants
**Implicit bias or Unconscious bias**
- collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge.
- These attitudes and stereotypes are often negative, exclusionary, or disempowering.

**Serial position effect** 
- is a psychological bias that states that when given a list of items, people are more likely to remember the first few and the last few while the items in the middle tend to blur.

**Friendliness bias** 
- describes the tendency of people to agree with those they like in order to maintain a nonconfrontational conversation.

**social desirability bias**
- which describes the tendency for people to answer questions in a way that will be viewed favorably by others. 
- the social desirability bias can cause participants to focus on the positive aspects of their experience with the product and minimize the negative aspects.
- Ask participants which statement they most relate to, and emphasize that there is no correct answer.

**Confirmation bias** 
- is the tendency to focus on information that matches a pre-existing belief.

```ad-important
five to eight participants when conducting a usability study.
```

**Leading Questions**
- are research questions that are intentionally framed to guide participants to respond in a certain way. 

**Hawthorne effect** 
- describes how people tend to act differently when they know they’re being watched. People often work harder or perform better when they know they are participants in a research study or experiment.

**How to reduce bias when conducting usability studies**
- identify and admit your own biases.
- find participants from a representative sample.
    - The small group of participants you conduct your usability study with should represent your key user group as well as user groups that are often marginalized.
- define the research criteria beforehand.
- phrase interview questions thoughtfully
    -  "how did it go?" 
    - "What was your experience like," 
    - or "what worked and what didn't work for you and why?"
- let participants express themselves fully and in their own words
### Use note-taking methods dusting usability studies 
1. Capture any thoughts you have during the usability study
- It helps you capture thoughts that the participants may or may not verbalize. 
2. you might take notes to summarize a participant's experience during the study.
3. highlight compelling quotes to include in your research report


**Spreadsheet note-taking**
-  is a simple and easy method to keep your notes organized using a spreadsheet.
- categories:
    - tasks
        - Here you can list the participant's name and each of the prompts that the participant will be guided to complete during the study.
    - click path
        - is the route the participants take to complete a task during the study.
    - observations
        - note down behaviors, opinions,  and attitudes, along with any errors, issues, or areas of confusion.
        - providing an indirect understanding of the behaviors and opinions of potential users.
    - quotes
    - task completion
        - 1 - focuses on how easily the task was to complete.
        - 2 - two for completed, but with difficulty
        - 3 - for not completed.
    
**SUMMARY**
- differences between a moderated and unmoderated usability study. 
- learned how to moderate a usability study. 
- gained an understanding of the biases that might come into play during a usability study, and how to reduce that bias. 
- Discovered how to take notes while observing participants in a usability study.

## WEEK 3:
