**REJECTED BY THE COMPANY**
Good day,  
  
Thank you so much for considering my candidacy for the internship position and for letting me know your decision. I enjoyed having the opportunity to speak to you.  
  
If there are any openings in other departments moving forward that I may be a better fit for, I would love to be kept in mind for future opportunities.  
  
Thank you again for your time and support through this process. Have a wonderful weekend!  
  
Best regards,  
Erica Jobelle Ayudan
